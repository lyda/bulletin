1. Need to extract these dirs again - missing some files:
     decus/vax87a/bbs again
     decus/vax87d/rcaf87/netnew
     vax88a3/rcas88/nets88/
     vax88b5/rcaf88/netf88/
     vax91b/gce91b/net91b
     vms94a/london
     vms93a/gce93a/net93a
     vax92a/gce92a/net92a/
     vax90b1/gce90b/net90b/
2. Need to get a dump of ls -lR or something.  Git doesn't save any of
   the file time attributes and they might be of use.
