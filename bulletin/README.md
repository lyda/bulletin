## Port to Linux

While a rewrite is preferred, a port might be possible.  Some interesting
links on getting VMS FORTRAN running on a Linux/Unix system:

  * A [script](http://www.simconglobal.com/vms.html) to do this
    using a proprietary tool called FTP. Need to contact them about
    licensing.
  * Things to [look out for](http://labs.hoffmanlabs.com/node/225).
