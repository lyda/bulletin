Added /INDENT=string to allow different indentation string.  3/12/94

Added ability to allow BULLCP to gateway for NEWS access via TCP (for MULTINET
only).  2/24/94

V 2.19

Add /MATCH qualifier to SEARCH command, and allow more than 1 string to be
specified.  12/2/93

Fixed the qualifer /CC when posting or resonding to messages.  It was supposed

Fixed bug which caused only partial storage of specified local news groups.
2/5/93

Fixed bug that caused privilege error and crash to occur after a non-privileged
user posted a message to a folder which had an associated mailing list.  2/5/93

V 2.14

the username ANONYMOUS rather than the actual username.  2/1/93

Added /EXTRACT qualifie to DIRECTORY command.  1/31/93

Added notification of new executable and possible new features.  1/26/93

Fixed bug in posting to stored news group by non-privileged users.  12/28/92

V 2.12

Fixed SET ACCESS /ALL which broke due to changes in V 2.11.  12/28/92

Fixed problem with reply posting to stored news group not posting to proper
group.  12/28/92

Added code to allow setting access to news group or class of news groups.
Added /PRIVATE switch to SET NEWS.  Added /CLASS to SET ACCESS.  12/26/92

Fixed bug in code that does copying from news group to folder.  12/26/92

Added INCLUDE and EXCLUDE commands which allow avoiding reading messages based
on subject and address headers.  12/15/92

Fixed bug which caused folder corruption.  12/15/92

V 2.11

Added SET NEWS command.  Used for setting a news group or a class of news
groups to be stored on disk for quicker access by users (rather than being 
read by users directly from the server).  Can also disable access to a group. 
Users can set NOTIFY on stored groups.  11/5/92
                                       
NEWS command now by default shows only groups which are active.  Can show all
groups with /ALL command.  /STORED and /COUNT are new qualifiers.  11/5/92

Stored news groups are stored with data compression.  Normal folders can also be
stored that way if set with the SET COMPRESS command.  11/5/92

INDEX command modified to make it more useful.  /NEW is now the default, and now
only shows folders or groups that have new messages.  /SET added to show only
folders which have READNEW, SHOWNEW, or BRIEF set, and /SET is the default.
11/5/92

Fixed bug with BROADCAST routines which could cause BULLCP to go into MWAST
state.  11/5/92

Modified code which adds BBOARD messages to speed it up when multiple messages
are being added.  11/5/92
                                                 
Folder names can now be up to 44 letters long.  11/5/92

BULL_BBOARD_UPDATE and BULL_NEWS_UPDATE are now continuously translated by
BULLCP so that they can be changed dynamically.  11/5/92

BULLCP now is created with reasonable working quotas rather than PQL_ defaults
which are usually way too low.  11/5/92

Changed all variables to be long word multiples in order to be more ALPHA
compliant (and maybe faster because of it?).  11/5/92

/ROTATE added for read commands to allow reading messages encoded in ROT-13
coding.  This is used by some news groups to display messages which could be
taken as being offensive (i.e. rec.humor.funny).  11/5/92

Fixed many minor bugs that no one mentioned, so I won't either.  11/5/92

Fixed ADD/BROADCAST/EDIT not working with TPU.  8/13/92

V 2.10

Allow non-digest messages to be added to a folder which has DIGEST set.  8/6/92

Added ADD_ONLY attribute.  If a mailing address is present, when messages are
added to a folder, they will also be mailed to the address.  Users are
prevented from using the POST command.  Instead, the ADD command will be used
if the POST command is entered.  One use for this is a local board which is
also distributed to non-local users.  8/1/92

Added POST_ONLY attribute  This causes the ADD command to mail messages to the
mailing address if it is present, rather than add it to the folder.  8/1/92

Fixed several shutdown bugs.  7/23/92

Fixed PMDF broken by V2.09.  6/16/92

Added system logical name BULL_CUSTOM.  It is equated to a hex number string.  
Bit 0 set = need privileges to create folder, 1 set = captive account can
write files, 2 set = captive account can use editor.  5/25/92

V 2.09

Allow having more than one database by redefining BULL_DIR.  However, only 
directories that are defined in the list of equivalence names pointed to by
the system logical name BULL_DIR_LIST are allowed.  See AAREADME.TXT
for more info.  5/10/92

GENERAL folder can now be renamed or modified (not deleted).  4/22/92

/FROM, /NOREPLIES, & /NEGATED added to SEARCH and DIRECTORY commands.  3/18/92

Mail routines now use MAIL$ calls for outgoing mail for faster execution.  
3/15/92

Changing keypad definitions using initialization file now possible.  3/12/92

Subscribed news groups are now listed in alphabetical order.  3/7/92

V 2.08

Fixed bug which caused missing news groups. See NEWS.TXT for info.  2/25/92

Allow setting local protection on remote folders.  12/12/91

Fixed bug with creation of folder files.  If they were deleted after the folder
was created, the files that would be created by BULLETIN to replace them (when
the folder is selected) would be created with the wrong protection.  12/12/91

Fix problem with MULTINET V3.0 and DECNET/NEWS gateway feature.  BULLCP will
hang without this fix if there is an attempt to read news via it.  12/9/91

Fix bug that causes incorrect time on news postings after the first post. 
Display time when reading news messages in local rather than GMT time.  12/8/91

Add 30 second timeout for connecting to nameserver for news.  Can be increased
up to 99 seconds via defining BULL_NEWS_TIMER.  12/3/91

Allow list of numbers when specifying message numbers for PRINT and FILE
commands.  11/27/91

Fixed bugs in BBOARD code:  Messages with lines > 255 characters would not be
included.  Subject line not correctly extracted if next line was simply a
To:. (relink PMDF driver if using PMDF for patch to take affect).  11/27/91

V 2.07

NEWS listing now shows the status of the news group, i.e. active, inactive,
moderated, or renamed.  10/23/91

Fixed PRINT command so that if a print qualifier (i.e. /QUEUE) is specified,
it will cause any pending print jobs to be printed if the qualifier for the
pending jobs is different.  10/23/91

Added /NOSIGNATURE qualifier for POST & RESPOND commands.  10/21/91

Fixed error in POST & RESPOND command.  If a file was specified on the command
line, and /EDIT was specified, the file would be sent even if the user quit out
of the edit, rather than exitting (i.e. outputting a file).  10/21/91

Fixed REPLY option in READNEW, as it was possible for users with only read
access to a folder to be able to add REPLY messages.  10/10/91

Add REPLY option to READNEW feature when reading messages.  Also, really fix
the REPLY command, as mentioned in V2.06.  8/11/91

V 2.06

Added code to keep track of which messages have been read a per message basis. 
Added SEEN & UNSEEN commands.  Added /SEEN, /UNSEEN, and /UNMARKED to
DIRECTORY, INDEX, READ, and SELECT commands.  Modified directory listing to
indicate which messages have been SEEN.  7/31/91 

Added /NOW to PRINT command.  Messages no longer have to be printed one message
at a time.  It now works identical to VMS MAIL.  7/31/91

Added code to NEWS users when new groups have been created.  User will be
alerted when selecting a news group that new groups are present, and will be
instructed to type NEWS/NEWGROUP in order to see them.  7/31/91

Added /PRINT to DIRECTORY command to allow printing of messages which are found
by using the DIRECTORY command.  7/31/91

Modified directory listing display so that the first and last message in the
folder are now displayed at the top.  Fixed bug which truncated very large news
group names.  7/31/91

Added FIRST command to read first message found in folder.  7/31/91

Modified REPLY command for folders associated with mailing lists, so that the
reply message to the mailing list rather than adding a local message.  7/31/91

Modified code to correctly store subject headers from BBOARD mail which are
more than one line long.  Previously, the subject would be truncated.  6/18/91

V 2.05

The MARK code was modified to work with NEWS folders.  6/3/91

Added /FOLDER=(folder,[...]) to the SEARCH command to allow searching more than
one folder at a time.  6/13/91

NEWS/SUBSCRIBED listing was fixed.  If the list could not fit on a single page,
a folder was skipped when the next page was shown.  6/3/91

INDEX was fixed.  If it was used with the qualifiers /NEW or /MARK, and the
directory listing of a folder was displayed, and then RETURN is entered to 
skip to the next folder, the directory display of the next folder would be
incorrect.  6/3/91 

Fixed broadcast bug.  If a message was added with /BROADCAST to a remote folder
from a node in a cluster which was not the node that BULLCP was running on. 
The broadcast would appear twice on the cluster.  5/24/91

Added code to alert user if message too large to be fully broadcasted.  5/24/91

Added code to avoid erroneous notifications of new messages for an empty NEWS
group.  Unlike a similar fix in V2.03 which was due to a bug, this fix may not
affect all sites, as it depends on the behavior of the server.  5/22/91 

Fixed NEWS to FOLDER feed.  A recent change broke it.  5/22/91

Added /EDIT qualifier for MAIL.  5/20/91

Added /HEADER qualifier for LAST, BACK, and CURRENT commands.  5/19/91

Added TWG (Wollongong) interface for NEWS.  5/18/91

Fixed bug which truncated subject headers of messages created when using REPLY
and RESPOND to messages which have long subject lines.  5/12/91

V2.04

Added ALWAYS attribute for folders.  Any SYSTEM messages in a folder in which
ALWAYS has been set will be displayed every time a user logs in, rather than
just once.  Also, non-SYSTEM messages will be displayed continuously (via
whatever mode is set, i.e. READNEW, SHOWNEW, or BRIEF) until it is actually
read.  4/29/91 

Added capability of controlling the time between updates for BBOARD and NEWS in
BULLCP by defining the logical names BULL_BBOARD_UPDATE or BULL_NEWS_UPDATE to
the number of minutes of desired time in minutes. 4/27/91

Added /GROUPS= qualifier to all commands which post to NEWS groups. 4/26/91

Fixed bug which prevented SET SHOWNEW or READNEW from working with subscribed
news group folders. 4/25/91

V2.03

Added /FOLDER to SHOW USER in order to show the latest message that a user
has read in the specified folder.  Also added /SINCE and /START (the former
for real folders, the latter for news groups).  4/11/91

Fixed logic so that defining BULL_NEWS_ORGANIZATION will override the
definition defined in BULLNEWS.INC.  4/10/91

Fixed SEARCH command, as it broke in V2.02 when /EDIT was added to read
message commands.  There is a missing QUALIFIER EDIT in BULLCOM.CLD for the
SEARCH verb.  /EDIT now works with SEARCH.  4/9/91

Fixed bug in BULLCP which prevented the DECNET/INTERNET NEWS gateway software
from working with UCX.  4/9/91 

Fixed bug caused by V2.00 which caused incorrect listing of message during
BULL/LOGIN for remote folders.  4/3/91

Fixed bugs which caused erroneous new message notifications for subscribed
NEWS groups that were empty.	3/27/91

V 2.02

Include BBOARD support for MX (courtesy of goathunter@wkuvx1.bitnet).

Changed BBOARD algorithm so that it is now possible to have only one real
BBOARD account, and have all the others be VMS MAIL forwarding entries.
See HELP SET BBOARD MORE_INFO for more info (it's been updated).

Added hook to allow postings from BULLETIN to a LISTSERV mailing list to use
the BBOARD account from it was subscribed to.  See HELP SET BBOARD LISTSERV.

Fixed many bugs in POST, REPLY, and RESPOND.

Fixed /ALL for COPY, PRINT, and EXTRACT when using NEWS groups.

Included RMS optimizer procedure for indexed files to optimize BULLNEWS.DAT
to speed up NEWS updates.  Can be used on other files (in particular
BULLINF.DAT) in order to save space.

Add /EDIT to BACK, NEXT, LAST, and when entering message number.

Modify ADD/REPLY command to local (non-NEWS) folders so if there are new
messages present, it doesn't reset the newest message count.  Previously,
adding a message would reset the user's last read message date to that message
in order to avoid notifying the user of new messages due to the user's own
message. 

Fixed code so that when reading new messages, and if READ/EDIT or DELETE/IMMED-
IATE IS entered, a carriage return will read the next new message.  Previously
the wrong message would be displayed.

V 2.01

Fixed many bugs associated with USENET NEWS reading feature.

Added UCX interface for NEWS.

Added signature file for POST and RESPOND messages.

Added capability to specify file name for POST, REPLY, and RESPOND.

Added the line "In a previous message, <message-owner> wrote:" to the
beginning of a message when /EXTRACT is specified

Added hook for network mail to run command procedure rather then using
VMS MAIL.  BULL_MAILER can be defined to point to the procedure, and it
is called with the username and subject as the parameters.

V 2.00

Added USENET NEWS reading feature.

V 1.93

Fixed bug which wouldn't allow a permanent message to be added by a
non-privileged user in a remote folder (the folder had been setup to allow
permanent messages from non-privileged users, of course). 

Fixed bug which causes the DELETE command not to delete a SHUTDOWN message
without the use of /IMMEDIATE.

Fixed the algorithm which prevented duplicate notification of messages in
remote folders on different nodes, as duplication was still possible.

V 1.92

Fixed bug which causes BULLCP to loop when trying to cleanup a folder which
has more than 127 identifiers granted access to a folder.  Also correct
SHOW FOLDER/FULL, which had a similar problem when trying to display the
identifiers.

Fix PMDF interface to recognize to recognize PMDF_PROTOCOL.

V 1.91

Disallow SPAWN command for CAPTIVE account.

Fix MAIL command to correctly allow passing addresses with quotes, i.e.
IN%"""MRL@NERUS.PFC.MIT.EDU""".

V 1.90

SET NOTIFY now works for remote folders.

Avoid generating notification message due to SET NOTIFY flag if the message
was broadcasted when added using ADD/BROADCAST.

Bug in DIR/SINCE for remote folders fixed.  If no new messages were present,
it would incorrectly show messages.

Added /FF to EXTRACT command to seperate messages in the file with form feeds.

Allow specifying CURRENT and LAST when specifying a range of messages for
commands that accept a range, i.e. EXTRACT 1-CURRENT, CURRENT-LAST, etc.

Open folder files with READONLY when not writing to them in order to avoid
changing modification date, which results in unnecessary backups.

Modify HELP so that it won't prompt for Subtopic is there is none.

Prevent screen from being erased after exiting HELP.

Fix bug which causes CREATE/NOTIFY to crash.

SET NOTIFY/CLUSTER has been removed.  As of VMS V5.2, it is possible to obtain
the list of users logged in to all nodes of a cluster, so this qualifier is no
long necessary.  NOTE: You can delete all the BULL_DIR:*.NOTIFY files, as they
are no longer used.

BULLETIN now will use the editor specified by the SET EDITOR command within
MAIL for editing messages.

Typing BACK after typing a DIRECTORY command will now show the previous 
DIRECTORY display entries rather than reading the previous message.

Several bugs related to the MARK command were fixed.  Also the software has been
optimized so that scanning for MARKed messages should take less time.

/EXPIRATION added to DIRECTORY command to show expiration rather than creation
date of messages.

Any BULLETIN interactive command can be executed at DCL level by typing
BULLETIN "command" or BULLETIN "command1;command2;etc.".

The CHANGE command has been modified so a range of message can be specified,
i.e. /NUMBER=1-10.  Also, the code incorrectly misinterpreted /TEXT as meaning
to extract the old text message, whereas it should have meant that only the
text was to be changed.  This prevented a user from specifying that only the
text should be changed if that user didn't have editing enabled.  This has been
fixed.  To eliminate confusing, the /TEXT qualifier on the ADD command has been
removed (previously it was a synonym for /EXTRACT). 

SHOW FOLDER/FULL display of access IDs was fixed to correctly display UICs.

Removed security hole which occurs if you are using the old method of accessing
a remote node via /NODES (it would have required looking a the sources to find,
which one installer did and was worried about).  Because of this, if you use
this old method (i.e. via BULLETIN.COM), the object BULLETIN must be installed
in the NCP database pointing to the file BULLETIN.COM, i.e. the command
"MCR NCP SET BULLETIN FILE directory:BULLETIN.COM NUMBER 0" must be executed
during the system startup.

Fixed bug in /LOGIN display when erasing page if terminal is hardcopy.  No
page would be erased (of course), and the next line outputted would start where
the previous line left off, rather than starting on a new line.

Added BULLETIN/WIDTH=page_width for users who have BULLETIN/LOGIN in their
login procedure before the terminal is known, and whose default page width is
larger (i.e. 132) than what the terminals are (i.e. 80).

Added BULLETIN/PGFLQUOTA and /WSEXTENT in order to set those quotas for the
BULLCP process.

Added ATTACH command.

Modify SET STRIP so that it saves the date that the message was sent and
leaves it at the to of the message.

BULLETIN will search BBOARD message headers for a line that starts with
"Expires:" or "X-Expires:", followed by a date (DD MMM YYYY or similar).  It if
finds that line, it will use that date as the expiration date of the message. 

Added /REPLY to SEARCH command.  Modified so that it's possible to abort out of
a /SUBJECT or /REPLY search using CTRL-C (previous possible only if searching
the text for a string.  Also, if you hit CTRL-C at the wrong time, BULLETIN
would abort totally rather than just aborting the search). 

Added /SEARCH= /SUBJ= and /REPLY to the DIRECTORY command.  Basically this is
combining the DIRECTORY and SEARCH commands.

Fixed design flaw which allowed the following to occur:  If a folder is a
remote system folder, when BULLETIN/LOGIN was executed, the same messages might
be displayed on both the local and remote nodes.  BULLETIN now will know that
the user has seen the message on one node and will not display it if that user
logs in on the other node.

Optimized code which caused slow display of new messages when executing
BULLETIN/LOGIN without /REVERSE for a remote folder.

Added /PERMANENT to SET NOTIFY, SHOWNEW, BRIEF, and READNEW.  The affect is
that users will not be allowed to change the setting.  The main intent here
was to allow the removal ofthe permanent setting of SHOWNEW from the GENERAL
folder.

Fixed bug which would cause a SYSTEM message not to be shown if SET BRIEF was
selected for that folder, and a non-SYSTEM message was also present.

Added SET CONTINUOUS_BRIEF.  This causes the SET BRIEF setting to show that
there are unread new messages every time BULLETIN/LOGIN is executed, rather
than just the one time.  The BRIEF notification code has also been optimized
so that it'll take less time to notify you of new messages.

A major bug was fixed which was introduced in previous mods to speed up
BULLETIN/LOGIN.  The effect is that no notifications will appear for certain
folders via BULLETIN/LOGIN.  This would only happen if a folder was removed at
some time.
