Non-system bulletins (such as this) can be submitted by any user.  Users are
alerted at login time that new non-system bulletins have been added, but only
their topics are listed.  Optionally, users can be prompted at login time to
see if they wish to read the bulletins.  When reading the bulletins in this
manner, the bulletins can optionally be written to a file.  If you have the
subdirectory [.BULL] created, BULLETIN will use that directory as the default
directory to write the file into.

A user can disable this prompting featuring by using BULLETIN as follows: 

$ BULLETIN
BULLETIN> SET NOREADNEW
BULLETIN> EXIT

Afterwords, the user will only be alerted of the bulletins, and will have to
use the BULLETIN utility in order to read the messages.
