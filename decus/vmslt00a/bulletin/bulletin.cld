!  This file is the CLD file used to define a command to execute
!  BULLETIN by using CDU, which adds the command  to the command table.
!  The alternative is to define a symbol to execute BULLETIN.
!  Either way will work, and it is up to the user's to decide which
!  method to work.  (If you don't know which, you probably should use
!  the default symbol method.)
