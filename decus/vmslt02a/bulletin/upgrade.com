$!  Normally, new versions of BULLETIN don't require any special
$!  installation except to link and install the new executable (and
$!  possibly relink PMDF or MX interfaces if any changes affect them).
$!  However, when there is a change to the data file format, you should run
$!  the following procedure.         
$!
$!  This is a sample upgrade procedure.  You will have to modify references
$!  to the directory where the new executables are stored, which are marked
$!  with ***. You will also have to change the references to the procedures
$!  that link either PMDF or MX.  These procedures usually replace the old
$!  executable, but that should not be done until BULLETIN has been disabled
$!  (by defining the logical name BULL_DISABLE).  If you run this procedure
$!  with a parameter (i.e. @UPGRADE LINK), it will call those linking
$!  procedures. Alternatively, you could define BULL_DISABLE and run those
$!  procedures manually.  Or, you could change them so they don't replace the
$!  old procedures and run them manually, and simply have this procedure
$!  replace them.  Whatever you find more convenient.
$!  
$!  This procedure should be run on all stand alone nodes or boot nodes of
$!  clusters on which bulletin is installed. After running upgrade.com, run
$!  restart.com to restart bulletin.  If you don't make use of remote
$!  folders, you can run restart.com immediately after upgrade.com rather
$!  than waiting to install the new version on all nodes.  Otherwise, you
$!  should try to run this procedure simultaneously on all clusters and then
$!  wait until it finishes on all nodes before running restart.com. 
$!  Otherwise, remote folder access attempts will fail.
