BULLETIN has the capability to read and post messages  to  USENET  NEWS  in  a
client  mode.  I realize that there are many NEWS readers, some with much more
elegant interfaces.  However, I elected to modify BULLETIN for  the  following
reason:   We have many decnet nodes, but only several are internet nodes.  Our
only access  to  a  news  server  was  via  internet.    In  order  for  those
non-internet  nodes  to read USENET, the only method that seemed available was
to run a NEWS server program on one of our own internet nodes so that it could
be accessible via decnet.  I did not want to do that, as that requires storing
the news groups on disk, and I do not have the room for that.   I  thus  added
the  ability  in  BULLETIN  (actually  BULLCP) so that it acts as as a gateway
between decnet and tcp for NEWS.  This method does not  require  spawning  any
processes,  since the detached process BULLCP is always present, so the access
is very fast.  Also, since BULLETIN uses a shared database to  store  info  on
the  NEWS  groups and periodically updates it, there is no need for that to be
done when a user accesses the NEWS groups.  Several other NEWS readers do this
when you run them, which is why they take a long time to start up.  It is also
possible to feed NEWS groups into  a  "real"  BULLETIN  folder,  so  that  the
messages are saved on disk (see the file NEWS_TO_FOLDER.TXT). 

Presently, BULLETIN can be used with  either  UCX,  MULTINET,  or  CMU  TCP/IP
packages  (and of course DECNET) for reading NEWS.  Support for other packages
can be added if I can find sites willing to beta test the  interface  for  me.
The  source  for  the  TCP  interface  is in C rather than FORTRAN because the
MULTINET include files are in C. However, if you do not have C, I will be glad
to send the object for it (or to even possibly rewrite the code in FORTRAN). 

The instructions for installation are as follows.  Define BULL_NEWS_SERVER  to
be a system logical name pointing to either your internet or decnet NEWS node.
If it is decnet, simply specify the decnet node name, i.e. 

	$ DEFINE/SYSTEM BULL_NEWS_SERVER NERUS

BULLETIN decides to use DECNET rather than TCP access based on the node  name.
If it does not have any periods in it, then it assumes it is a DECNET node. 

In our cluster, we usually have one node which is an internet  node,  and  the
rest  non-internet  nodes.    If  you have a similar situation, you'll have to
create a startup procedure that defines BULL_NEWS_SERVER to  be  the  internet
news  server  address  only  on  the  node (or nodes) on the cluster that have
actually internet access.  The other nodes will have BULL_NEWS_SERVER  defined
as the decnet node name that BULLCP is running on in the cluster.  (Of course,
BULLCP will have to be running on a node with internet access.)

NOTE: If you want to disable the gateway feature, then before starting BULLCP,
define the logical name: 

	$ DEFINE/SYSTEM BULL_NO_NEWS_GATEWAY "TRUE"

Defining this will only shut off the gateway.  BULLETIN will still be  allowed
to read NEWS from the local node as long as BULL_NEWS_SERVER is defined. 

You can also specify that BULLCP is only to act as a NEWS gateway.  This is to
allow  adding the news gateway to an INTERNET site that you have DECNET access
to, but which does not want to make use of any of the other BULLETIN features.
You would specify the following command before starting BULLCP: 

	$ DEFINE/SYSTEM BULL_NEWS_GATEWAY_ONLY "TRUE"

It is also possible for BULLETIN to access news groups  that  are  located  on
other  news  servers than the one specified by BULL_NEWS_SERVER.  This is done
by creating the  file  BULL_DIR:BULL_ALT_NEWS.LIS  and  adding  a  line  which
containsthe  name  of  the  news group and the news server where it's located.
The format is news-group-name:news-server-name.

In order to post messages, BULLETIN needs to know the internet nodename of the
local host.  This is done automatically for nodes running MULTINET.  For other
nodes, BULLETIN attempts to  translate  the  logical  name  ARPANET_HOST_NAME,
INTERNET_HOST_NAME, and MX_NODE_NAME.  If you are on a DECNET node that is not
on INTERNET (and is not part of a cluster which has an INTERNET address),  but
you are accessing NEWS via DECNET, you can specify the hostname as follows: 

     $ DEFINE/SYSTEM INTERNET_HOST_NAME "%localhost@internet-address"

Where "localhost" is your local decnet hostname, and "internet-address" is the
internet address of the gateway node. 

The local time zone is detected by looking at  the  following  logical  names:
LISP$TIME_ZONE,  MULTINET_TIMEZONE,  or  PMDF_TIMEZONE.    (LISP$TIME_ZONE  is
defined if you have LISP installed.)

The name of the organization is included in the header of  the  NEWS  message.
This can be anything, but usually is the company or university name.  This can
be hardcoded into the source by putting in BULLNEWS.INC, or  by  defining  the
system logical name BULL_NEWS_ORGANIZATION. 

The name of the mail protocol to use for responding by mail to  NEWS  messages
can  also  be  either hardcoded by putting in BULLNEWS.INC, or by defining the
system logical name BULL_NEWS_MAILER. 

After installing the new BULLETIN, execute the command NEWS, which asks for  a
list  of  all the news groups.  Because this is the first time it is executed,
it will cause a load of all the remote news groups  into  a  local  data  base
(BULL_DIR:BULLNEWS.DAT). This will take several minutes to do.  It is the only
time that this load will be  done  interactively.    Afterwards,  BULLCP  will
periodically  update  the data base.  For this reason, it is highly recommeded
that BULLCP be installed. BULLCP will update NEWS every hour.  If you want  to
change  this frequency, define the logical name BULL_NEWS_UPDATE to the number
of minutes in between updates, i.e. DEFINE/SYSTEM BULL_NEWS_UPDATE "30" for 30
minutes.    NOTE:  BULLCP  will create a subprocess BULLCP NEWS which does the
update.  You can watch how long it takes for this to run in order to determine
if you want to change the update period). 

Due to long news group names recently created, you must do the following, or
else those news groups will not be seen.  After BULLNEWS.DAT is created, do
the following:

$ ANAL/RMS/FDL/OUT=FIX.FDL BULL_DIR:BULLNEWS.DAT

Edit FIX.FDL and find the first line which says
	DUPLICATES no
and change it to
	DUPLICATES yes

Then type:

$ CONVERT BULL_DIR:BULLNEWS.DAT BULL_DIR:BULLNEWS.DAT/FDL=FIX.FDL

Also, it is suggested that you run OPTIMIZE_RMS.COM on it, as it will cause the
file to be compressed and will allow updates to run much faster (factor of 5 or
more). 

Never delete BULLNEWS.DAT.  There is no reason to ever  do  so,  and  it  will
cause subscribed users to be subscribed to the wrong news groups. 

WARNING: One user discovered that his server (using bnews?) had  a  bug  which
caused  the updates to cause bogus "new messages" notifications for subscribed
NEWS group when entering BULLETIN.    If  you  experience  this  problem,  try
defining  the  system  logical name BULL_SPECIAL_NEWS_UPDATE.  This will cause
the update to use a different algorithm which should  eliminate  the  problem,
although it requires much more time to execute. 

If you have any problems or questions, please let me know.
