BULLETIN   is   public   domain   software.    (I   will  gladly  accept
recommendations for new features,  not  for  changes  that  are  due  to
"personal" preference.)

If you are running a version of BULLETIN older than 2.11,  this  version
will  modify  the  format of some of the data files.  (This will be done
automatically  when  the  new  version  is   run).    After   successful
installation,  the  older  versions of these files can be removed. NOTE:
Problems  can  occur if  the  old  version  of BULLETIN is run after the
data files have been modified.  Such a situation is possible on a
cluster where each node has installed  the  executable  separately.   To 
help  installation,  a new command procedure UPGRADE.COM has been 
included.  Read the comments in the file for information on how to use
it. 
 
NOTE: The following commands can be sent to BULLETIN@PSFC.MIT.EDU:
	SEND ALL [SINCE time]	Sends all bulletin files.
				If SINCE time specified, only files created
				since that time will be sent.
	SEND filename		Sends the specified file.	
	BUGS			Sends a list of the latest bug fixes.
	HELP or INFO		Sends a brief description of BULLETIN.
	SUBSCRIBE               Subscribes to mailing list for upgrade
                                notifications.
        UNSUBSCRIBE             Unsubscribes from mailing list.

NOTE:  An old bug might have changed the protection on the BULLETIN data
files.  The protection on all data files (i.e.  B*.DAT,  *.BULLFIL,  and
*.BULLDIR) should be (RWED,RWED,,).

You will be receiving 22 files (NOT NECESSARILY IN THIS ORDER!):
	1) BULLETIN.FOR
	2) BULLETIN0.FOR
	3) BULLETIN1.FOR
	4) BULLETIN2.FOR
	5) BULLETIN3.FOR
	6) BULLETIN4.FOR
	7) BULLETIN5.FOR
	8) BULLETIN6.FOR
	9) BULLETIN7.FOR
	10) BULLETIN8.FOR
	11) BULLETIN9.FOR
	12) BULLETIN10.FOR
	13) BULLETIN11.FOR
	14) ALLMACS.MAR
	15) BULLCOMS1.HLP
	16) BULLCOMS2.HLP
	17) BULLET1.COM
	18) BULLET2.COM
	19) PMDF.COM
	20) MX.COM
        21) NEWS.COM
	22) ALLMACS_AXP.MAR

(They  will  be  identified  in  the  SUBJECT  header.)  BULLET1.COM and
BULLET2.COM are command procedures which when run, will  create  several
small files.  After you run them, you can delete them.  If you have PMDF
at your site, you should also run PMDF.COM.  However, this only  applies
to  PMDF  V3.2  or earlier, as later versions of PMDF have the necessary
interface code for BULLETIN included in it.  In that case,  or  in  case
you  don't have PMDF, you can delete it.  The same applies to MX.  Then,
read AAAREADME.TXT for BULLETN installation instructions.   If  you  are
using the news feature, NEWS.COM contains files which pertain to news.

NOTE: When creating these files (using the EXTRACT command) from the VMS
MAIL utility, you will have to strip  off  any  mail  headers  that  are
present,  including blank lines.
