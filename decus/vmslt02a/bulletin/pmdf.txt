To allow PMDF to be able to transfer mail to BULLETIN folders, edit the file
PMDF_TABLE:PMDF.CNF, and append the following 5 lines to the rewrite section
(make sure you do not include any lines with spaces in that section.  Replace
the string "urdomain", with your domain (i.e., my domain is PSFC.MIT.EDU).

!
! Rewrites for bulletin channel
!
BULLETIN             $U%BULLETIN@BULLETIN-DAEMON
BULLETIN.urdomain    $U%BULLETIN@BULLETIN-DAEMON

Then, add the following 5 lines to the channel section (or just put it at the
end of that file).                    

!
! The BULLETIN Channel rule
!
bull_local single master slave_debug master_debug logging defragment charset7 us-ascii charset8 iso-8859-1
BULLETIN-DAEMON

After you do this, you can now link and install the BULLETIN executable using
PMDF.COM  Once you do that, if you want email messages to be automatically
transferred to a BULLETIN folder, you will need to add an alias to
PMDF_TABLE:PMDF.CNF  For example, if you email sent to TEST to be placed in
the TEST folder, you would add the line:

test: test@bulletin  

Note that folder names do not necessarily have to match account names.
