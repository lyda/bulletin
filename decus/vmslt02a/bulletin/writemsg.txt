BULLETIN contains subroutines for writing a message directly to a folder.  This
would be useful for someone who is using the BBOARD feature, but wants to avoid
the extra overhead of having the message sent to an account as MAIL, and then
have BULLCP read the mail.  It is better if the network mail could be written
directly to the folder bypassing VMS MAIL, as it reduces a lot of cpu overhead.
