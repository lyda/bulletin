$! BOARD_SPECIAL.COM
$!
$! Command file invoked by folder associated with a BBOARD which is
$! is specified with /SPECIAL.  This can be used to convert data to
$! a message via a different means than the VMS mail.  This is done by
$! converting the data to look like output created by the MAIL utility,
$! which appears as follows:
$!
$!	First line is 0 length line.
$!	Second line is "From:" followed by TAB followed by incoming username
$!	Third line is "To:" followed by TAB followed by BBOARD username
$!	Fourth line is "Subj:" followed by TAB followed by subject
$!	The message text then follows.
$!	Message is ended by a line containing a FORM FEED.
$!
$! This command file should be put in the BBOARD_DIRECTORY as specified
$! in BULLFILES.INC.  You can also have several different types of special
$! procedures.  To accomplish this, rename the file to the BBOARD username.
$! i.e. if you specify SET BBOARD FOO/SPECIAL, you could name the file
$! FOO.COM and it will execute that rather than BOARD_SPECIAL.COM.
$!
$! The following routine is the one we use to convert mail from a non-DEC
$! mail network.  The output from this mail is written into a file which
$! is slightly different from the type outputted by MAIL.
$!
$! (NOTE: A username in the SET BBOARD command need only be specified if
$! the process which reads the mail requires that the process be owned by
$! a specific user, which is the case for this sample, and for that matter
$! when reading VMS MAIL.  If this is not required, you do not have to
$! specify a username.)
