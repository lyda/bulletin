Subject: BULLETIN

BULLETIN USERS:
A bug was recently brought to my attention.  If a new user logs in, and the
/REVERSE switch is on the BULLETIN/LOGIN command, the code does not display
the appropriate new messages.  The problem is in BULLETIN0.FOR, so I'm
sending a new copy of that to everyone.

(A brand new user should see all permanent SYSTEM messages and the first
non-system message in the GENERAL folder.  I limit it to that, since otherwise
if there are a lot of messages in the GENERAL folder, a new user might end up
getting page fulls of messages.)

The LOGIN.COM that I distribute didn't used to have /REVERSE as the default,
but I just changed that.  To me, it makes more sense to see the oldest
messages first, since the new messages might refer to older messages.
