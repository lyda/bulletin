1 PRINT
Queues a copy of the message you are currently reading (or have just
read)  for  printing. The PRINT command can take optional qualifiers.

   Format:

       PRINT
2 /HEADER
 /[NO]HEADER

Controls whether a header containing the owner, subject, and date of the 
message is printed at the beginning. The default is to write the header.
2 /NOTIFY
 /[NO]NOTIFY

Indicates that you will be notified by a broadcast message  when  the
file or files have been printed.  If /NONOTIFY is specified, there
is no notification.  The default is /NOTIFY.
2 /QUEUE
 /QUEUE=queue_name

The name of the queue to which a message is to be sent.  If the /QUEUE
qualifier  is  not  specified,  the message is queued to SYS$PRINT.
1 READ
Displays the specified message.  If you do not specify a message, then
the first time you enter the command, the first message in the folder will
be displayed.  However, if there are new messages, the first new message
will be displayed.  Each time you enter the command, the next page, or if
there are no more pages, the next message will be displayed. 

  Format:
    READ [message-number]

The message's relative number is found by the DIRECTORY command.
If you specify a number greater than the number of messages in the
folder, the last message in the folder will be displayed.

NOTE: The READ command can be abbreviated by omitting the READ command,
i.e. typing the command "2" is equivalent to "READ 2", and simply hitting
the <RETURN> key is equivalent to "READ".
2 /EDIT
Specifies that the editor is to be used to read the message.  This is
useful for scanning a long message.
2 /NEW
Specifies to read the first unread message.
2 /PAGE
 /[NO]PAGE

Specifies that the display of the message will pause when it reaches the
end of the page.  If /NOPAGE is specified, the whole message will be
displayed.  This is useful for terminals that can store more than one
screenful at a time, and that have a remote printer that can then print
the contents of the terminal's memory.
2 /SINCE
 /SINCE=date

Specifies to read the first message created on or after the specified
date.  If no date is specified, the default is TODAY.
1 REMOVE
Removes a folder.  Only the owner of a folder or a privileged
user can remove the folder.

  Format:
    REMOVE folder-name
1 REPLY
Adds message with subject of message being the subject of the currently
read message with "RE:" preceeding it.  Format and qualifiers is exactly
the same as the ADD command except for /NOINDENT and /TEXT.
2 /NOINDENT
See /TEXT for information on this qualifier.
2 /TEXT
Specifies that the text of the message should be included in the reply
mail message.  This qualifier is valid only when used with /EDIT.  The
text of the message is indented with > at the beginning of each line.
This can be suppressed with /NOINDENT.
1 RESPOND
Invokes the VAX/VMS Personal Mail Utility (MAIL) to send a reply mail
message to the owner of the currently read message.  If the owner of the
message is not a valid user, it is assumed that the message was from
a network, and the message is searched for a line starting with "From:".
The username is then extracted from that line, and the necessary mail
routine to send over the network is invoked.
2 /EDIT
Specifies that the editor is to be used for creating the reply mail
message.
2 /NOINDENT
See /TEXT for information on this qualifier.
2 /SUBJECT
 /SUBJECT=text

Specifies the subject of the mail message. If the text consists of more
than one word, enclose the text in quotation marks (").

If you omit this qualifier, the description of the message will be used
as the subject preceeded by "RE: ".
2 /TEXT
Specifies that the text of the message should be included in the reply
mail message.  This qualifier is valid only when used with /EDIT.  The
text of the message is indented with > at the beginning of each line.
This can be suppressed with /NOINDENT.
1 QUIT
Exits the BULLETIN program.
1 SEARCH
Searches the currently selected folder for  the  message  containing
the first occurrence of the specified text string.

   Format:

       SEARCH [search-string]

The search starts from the first message in the current folder.  The
search includes both the text of the message, and the description header.
If a "search-string" is not specified, a search is made using the
previously specified string, starting with the message following the
one you are currently reading (or have just read).  Once started, a
search can be aborted by typing a CTRL-C.
2 /START
 /START=message_number

Specifies the message number to start the search at.
2 /SUBJECT
Specifies that only the subject of the messages are to be searched.
1 SELECT
Selects a folder of messages.  See HELP Folders for a description of a
folder.  Once a folder has been selected, all commands, i.e. DIRECTORY,
READ, etc. will apply only to those messages.  Use the CREATE command to
create a folder.  Use the DIRECTORY/FOLDER command to see the list of
folders that have been created. 

 Format:

     SELECT [node-name::][folder-name]

The complete folder name need not be specified.  BULLETIN will try to
find the closest matching name.  I.e. INFOV can be used for INFOVAX.

Omitting the folder name will select the default general messages.

The node name can be specified only if the remote node has the special
BULLCP process running (invoked by BULLETIN/STARTUP command.)

After selecting a folder, the user will notified of the number of unread
messages, and the message pointer will be placed at the first unread
message.
1 SET
The SET command is used with other  commands  to  define  or  change
characteristics  of  the  BULLETIN  Utility.

  Format:

    SET option
2 ACCESS
Controls access to a private folder.  A private folder can only be 
selected by users who have been granted access.  Only the owner of that 
folder is allowed to grant access.

  Format:

    SET [NO]ACCESS id [folder-name]

The parameter "id" is the id in the system Rights Database to which
access is being affected.  For more information concerning usage of
private folders, see HELP CREATE /PRIVATE.  NOTE: Access is created
by use of ACLs.  If a user is able to set his process's privileges
to override ACLs, that user will be able to access the folder even if
access has not been granted via BULLETIN.
3 id
The id can be anything in the system Rights Database.  This includes
3 /ALL
Specifies that access to the folder is granted to all users.
If /READ is not specified, the folder will no longer be private.
If /READ is specified, all users will have read access, but only
privileged users will have write access (of course non-privileged
users can gain access via a later SET ACCESS command.)

Format:

    SET ACCESS /ALL [folder-name]
3 /READ
Specifies that access to the folder will be limited to being able to
read the messages.
3 Warning
If a user logs in after a private folder has been created but before
being given access, and then is given access, any defaults that the
folder has, i.e. /BRIEF, /READNEW, & /NOTIFY, will not be set for that
user. This is because if the id is not a username, it becomes an
extremely lengthy operation to check each user to see if have that id
assigned to them.  The alternative is to set the defaults for all users
after every SET ACCESS, but that might cause problems with users who
have manually reset those defaults.  The correct solution requires a
large programming modification, which will be done in a later version. 
2 BBOARD
Specifies a username to be used as a BBOARD destination.  Mail which is
sent to that user are converted into messages.  This command will apply
to the selected folder, and each folder can have it's own BBOARD.  Only 
privileged users or owners of the folders can set BBOARD.  Note: The
specified account must have the DISUSER flag specified in the system
authorization file, and it either must be given SYSTEM privileges, or
the scratch bboard_directory (specified when compiling BULLETIN) must
have world rwed protection.  Also, you may have to increase some
subprocess system parameters: PQL_DPGFLQUOTA and PQL_DWSQUOTA are often
too low (10000 and 500 will work).  In some cases, PQL_DFILLIM will have
to be increased (but this is rare).  If you are not using the BULLCP
process, the subprocess limit for users must be at least 2. 

  Format:

    SET BBOARD [username]

BBOARD cannot be set for remote folders.

3 /EXPIRATION
 /EXPIRATION=days
 /NOEXPIRATION

Specifies the number of days the message created by the BBOARD is to be
retained.  The default is 14 days.  The highest limit that can be
specified is 30 days.  This can be overridden by a user with privileges.
If /NOEXPIRATION is specified, messages will become permanent.
3 /SPECIAL
Specifies that the input should be processed using a special command
procedure, and not to use the simple VMS MAIL to message conversion.
Specifying a username is optional.  To remove this feature, you must
either SET NOBBOARD, or SET BBOARD and specify a username.  See
installation notes for exactly how to use this feature.
3 /VMSMAIL
Used in conjunction with /SPECIAL.  If /SPECIAL and a username is
specified, and the conversion still takes it's input from VMS MAIL, then
the VMS system mail file is checked to see if new mail exists for the
specified user before running the command procedure.  This saves time and
avoids creating subprocesses.  (Useful if input is digest format.)
3 More_information

The following is relevant only if the messages in the BBOARD accounts
are sent via a method that causes the name of the account to be placed
in the TO: line of the VMS MAIL.  The normal MAIL utility, of course,
does this.  However, packages such as PMDF (and probably many others)
will not always do this.  (I.e. if the mail was sent to the account
using CC:, the address of the person to whom the mail was sent will be
placed in the TO: line rather than the CC: address.)

If more than one folder is to have a BBOARD setting, only one of the
BBOARD names need be a real account.  All other names could be names
whose mail is forwarded to the real account.  BULLETIN will then
determine from the mail header which folder the mail is to be sent to.
Forwarding can be enabled for any name within MAIL by the command:

    MAIL> SET FORWARD/USER=from_name to_name

Any mail sent to FROM_NAME will be forwarded to TO_NAME.  Thus, only
TO_NAME need be a real account.  For example, if you have INFOVAX and
LASER-LOVERS folders, you need create only a INFOVAX account, and then
forward LASER-LOVERS mail to INFOVAX within mail using the command SET
FORWARD/USER=LASER-LOVERS INFOVAX.  You would then do a SET BBOARD
INFOVAX for the INFOVAX folder, and SET BBOARD LASER-LOVERS for the
LASER-LOVERS folder.  This method will speed up the BBOARD conversion,
since mail need be read only from one account.  NOTE: Folders that have
the /SPECIAL set on their BBOARD accounts cannot have their mail forwarded
to BBOARD accounts that don't have /SPECIAL set.  Folders of the same
type, i.e. that use the same /SPECIAL command procedure, must be grouped
separately.
2 BRIEF
Controls whether you will be alerted upon logging that there are new
messages in the currently selected folder.  This cannot be specified for
the GENERAL folder.  The BRIEF setting contrasts with the READNEW
setting, which causes a listing of the description of the new messages
to be displayed and prompts the user to read the messages.  Setting
BRIEF will clear a READNEW setting (and visa versa).

  Format:

    SET [NO]BRIEF
3 /ALL
Specifies that the SET [NO]BRIEF option is the default for all users for
the specified folder.  This is a privileged qualifier.
3 /DEFAULT
Specifies that the [NO]BRIEF option is the default for the specified
folder.  This is a privileged qualifier.  It will only affect brand new
users (or those that have never logged in).  Use /ALL to modify all users.
3 /FOLDER
   /FOLDER=foldername

Specifies the folder for which the option is to modified.  If not
specified, the selected folder is modified. Valid only with NOBRIEF.
2 DUMP
Specifies that messages deleted from the selected folder are written
into a dump (or log) file.  The name of the log file is foldername.LOG,
and it is located in the folder directory.

  Format:

    SET [NO]DUMP

The command SHOW FOLDER/FULL will show if dump has been set.
(NOTE: SHOW FOLDER/FULL is a privileged command.)
2 EXPIRE_LIMIT
Specifies expiration limit that is allowed for messages.  Non-privileged
users cannot specify an expiration that exceeds the number of days
specified.  Privileged users can exceed the limit.

    SET [NO]EXPIRE_LIMIT [days]

The command SHOW FOLDER/FULL will show the expiration limit, if one exists.
(NOTE: SHOW FOLDER/FULL is a privileged command.)
2 FOLDER
Select a folder of messages.  Identical to the SELECT command.  See help
on that command for more information.

  Format:

    SET FOLDER [node-name::][folder-name]
2 GENERIC
Specifies that the given account is a "generic" account, i.e used by many
different people.  If an account is specified as GENERIC, new messages
placed in the GENERAL folder will be displayed upon logging in for a
specific number of days, rather than only once.  The default period is 7
days.  This command is a privileged command.

  Format:

    SET [NO]GENERIC username
3 /DAYS
 /DAYS=number_of_days

Specifies the number days that new GENERAL messages will be displayed
for upon logging in.
2 KEYPAD
Controls whether the keypad has been enabled such that the keys on the
keypad correspond to command definitions.  These definitions can be seen
via the SHOW KEYPAD command.  The default is NOKEYPAD unless the /KEYPAD
qualifier has been added to the BULLETIN command line.

  Format:

    SET [NO]KEYPAD
2 LOGIN
Controls whether the specified user will be alerted of any messages,
whether system or non-system, upon logging in.  If an account has the
DISMAIL flag set, SET NOLOGIN is automatically applied to that account
during the first time that the account logs in.  However, this will
not occur if DISMAIL is set for an old account.  Additionally, removing
the DISMAIL flag will not automatically enable LOGIN.  (The reason for
the above was to avoid extra overhead for constant checking for the
DISMAIL flag.)  This command is a privileged command.

  Format:

    SET [NO]LOGIN username
2 NODE
Modifies the selected folder from a local folder to a remote folder.
A remote folder is a folder in which the messages are actually stored
on a folder at a remote DECNET node.  When the SET NODE command is
executed, the remote node is checked to see if a folder of the same
name is located on that node.  If so, the selected folder will then
point to that folder.  If are any messages stored in the local folder,
they will be deleted.  This capability is only present if the BULLCP
process is created on the remote node via the BULL/STARTUP command.

  Format:

    SET NODE nodename
    SET NONODE

NOTE: If one node add a message to a remote node, other nodes connected
to the same folder will not immediately be aware of the new message.
That information is only updated every 15 minutes (same algorithm for 
updating BBOARD messages), or if a user accesses that folder.
3 /FOLDER
   /FOLDER=foldername

Specifies the folder for which the node information is to modified.
If not specified, the selected folder is modified.
2 NOTIFY
Specifies whether you will be notified via a broadcast message when a
message is added to the selected folder.

  Format:

    SET [NO]NOTIFY

This command does not presently work for remote folders.
3 /ALL
Specifies that the SET [NO]NOTIFY option is the default for all users for
the specified folder.  This is a privileged qualifier.
3 /DEFAULT
Specifies that the [NO]NOTIFY option is the default for the specified
folder.  This is a privileged qualifier.  It will only affect brand new
users (or those that have never logged in).  Use /ALL to modify all users.
3 /FOLDER
   /FOLDER=foldername

Specifies the folder for which the option is to modified.  If not
specified, the selected folder is modified. Valid only with NONOTIFY.
2 PAGE
Specifies whether any directory listing or message reading output will
pause when it reaches the end of the page or not.  Setting NOPAGE is 
useful for terminals that can store more than one screenful at a time,
and that have a remote printer that can then print the contents of the
terminal's memory.  The default is PAGE, unless the default was changed
by specifying /NOPAGE on the command line to invoke BULLETIN.

  Format:

    SET [NO]PAGE
2 PRIVILEGES
Specifies the privileges that are necessary to use privileged commands.
Use the SHOW PRIVILEGES command to see what privileges are presently set.
This is a privileged command.

  Format:

    SET PRIVILEGES privilege-list

Privilege-list is the list of privileges separated by commas. 
To remove a privilege, specify the privilege preceeded by "NO".
2 READNEW
Controls whether you will be prompted upon logging in if you wish to read 
new non-system or folder messages (if any exist).  The default is dependent
on how the folder was created by the owner.

In order to apply this to a specific folder, first select the folder 
(using the SELECT command), and then enter the SET READNEW command.
For messages in folders other than the GENERAL folder, both prompting 
and display of topics of new messages are controlled by this command.
For the GENERAL folder, the display of topics cannot be disabled.

  Format:

    SET [NO]READNEW

NOTE: If you have several folders with READNEW enabled, each folder's
messages will be displayed separately.  However, if you EXIT the READNEW
mode before all the folders have been displayed, you will not be alerted
of the new messages in the undisplayed folders the next time you login.
However, if you enter BULLETIN, you will be told that new messages are
present in those other folders.  Also, it is not possible to EXIT the
READNEW mode if there are SYSTEM folders which have new messages. Typing
the EXIT command will cause you to skip to those folders.  (See HELP
SET SYSTEM for a description of a SYSTEM folder).
3 /ALL
Specifies that the SET [NO]READNEW option is the default for all users for
the specified folder.  This is a privileged qualifier.  The difference
between this and /DEFAULT is that the latter will only apply to new users
(i.e. any users which have never executed BULLETIN).
3 /DEFAULT
Specifies that the [NO]READNEW option is the default for the specified
folder.  This is a privileged qualifier.  It will only affect brand new
users (or those that have never logged in).  Use /ALL to modify all users.
3 /FOLDER
   /FOLDER=foldername

Specifies the folder for which the option is to modified.  If not
specified, the selected folder is modified. Valid only with NOREADNEW.
2 SHOWNEW
Controls whether a directory listing of new messages for the current
folder will be displayed when logging in.  This is similar to READNEW,
except you will not be prompted to read the messages.  The default is
dependent on how the folder was created by the owner.

In order to apply this to a specific folder, first select the folder 
(using the SELECT command), and then enter the SET SHOWNEW command.
This command cannot be used for the GENERAL folder.

  Format:

    SET [NO]SHOWNEW
3 /ALL
Specifies that the SET [NO]SHOWNEW option is the default for all users for
the specified folder.  This is a privileged qualifier.  The difference
between this and /DEFAULT is that the latter will only apply to new users
(i.e. any users which have never executed BULLETIN).
3 /DEFAULT
Specifies that the [NO]SHOWNEW option is the default for the specified
folder.  This is a privileged qualifier.  It will only affect brand new
users (or those that have never logged in).  Use /ALL to modify all users.
3 /FOLDER
   /FOLDER=foldername

Specifies the folder for which the option is to modified.  If not
specified, the selected folder is modified. Valid only with NOSHOWNEW.
2 SYSTEM
Specifies that the selected folder is a SYSTEM folder.  A SYSTEM folder
is allowed to have SYSTEM and SHUTDOWN messages added to it.  This is a
privileged command.

  Format:

    SET [NO]SYSTEM

By default, the GENERAL folder is a SYSTEM folder, and the setting for
that folder cannot be removed.

If the selected folder is remote, /SYSTEM cannot be specified unless the
folder at the other node is also a SYSTEM folder.
1 SHOW
The SHOW command displays information about certain characteristics.
2 FLAGS
Shows whether BRIEF, NOTIFY, READNEW, or SHOWNEW has been set for the
currently selected folder.
2 FOLDER
Shows information about a folder of messages.  Owner and description are
shown.  If the folder name is omitted, and a folder has been selected via
the SELECT command, information about that folder is shown.

  Format:

    SHOW FOLDER [folder-name]
3 /FULL
Control whether all information of the folder is displayed.  This
includes DUMP & SYSTEM settings, the access list if the folder is
private, and BBOARD information.  This information is only those who
have access to that folder.
2 KEYPAD
Displays the keypad command definitions.  If the keypad has been enabled
by either the SET KEYPAD COMMAND, or /KEYPAD is specified on the command 
line, the keypad keys will be defined as commands.  SHOW KEYPAD is the
equivalent of HELP KEYPAD.

NOTE: If the keypad is not enabled, PF2 is defined to be SET KEYPAD.
2 /PRINT
Prints the keypad definitions on the default printer (SYS$PRINT).
2 NEW
Shows folders which have new unread messages for which BRIEF or READNEW
have been set.  (Note: If you enter BULLETIN but do not read new unread
messages, you will not be notified about them the next time you enter
BULLETIN.  This is a design "feature" and cannot easily be changed.)
2 PRIVILEGES
Shows the privileges necessary to use privileged commands.
1 UNDELETE
Undeletes the specified message if the message was deleted using the
DELETE command.  Deleted messages are not actually deleted but have their
expiration date set to 15 minutes in the future and are deleted then.
Undeleting the message will reset the expiration date back to it's original
value.  Deleted messages will be indicated as such by the string (DELETED)
when either reading or doing a directory listing.

  Format:
    UNDELETE [message-number]
