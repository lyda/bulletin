Subject: BULLETIN

WARNING: After upgrading to V5, you MUST reassemble ALLMACS.MAR before
relinking BULLETIN.  If you don't do this, running BULLCP will cause your
machine to crash. (Luckily, you are forced to relink BULLETIN, since it uses
shared libraries, and these have changed so you will be unable to INSTALL it. 
This will probably jog your memory to assemble ALLMACS, and thus avoid
rebooting under V5 and then have your machine crash repeatedly since BULLCP is
created by the system startup procedure, which is what happened to me!)

Also, I discovered more changes that were needed to allow the remote folder
feature to work under V5.  It requires a new BULLETIN8.FOR, which I will be
distributing shortly.
