1. Introduction
 
 
BULLETIN is a utility that serves as an electronic analog to a public
bulletin board. With it, you can post messages for other people to see,
and you can read messages posted by other users. Typical uses of
BULLETIN include ongoing discussions and notices on various topics. The
contents of the bulletin board are up to those who use it. The CRNL
Computing Center simply provides the structure - the corkboard and
thumbtacks as it were.
 
The organization of BULLETIN is modelled after VMS Mail. Individual
messages are grouped into topics (called folders in VMS Mail and in
BULLETIN), and within each topic, the messages are ordered
chronologically. Once you enter BULLETIN, you can move from one topic to
another, and skip around within a topic to read any messages that seem
interesting. BULLETIN automatically keeps track of the newest message
that your account has read in each topic, so you also have the option of
skipping over old messages.
 
Pictorially, the structure looks like this:
 
       ---------    ---------    ---------             ---------
        TOPIC   ---- TOPIC B ---- TOPIC C --- . . . --- TOPIC x
       ---------    ---------    ---------             ---------
       Message 1    Message 1    Message 1             Message 1
          .            .            .                     .
       Message 2    Message 2    Message 2             message 2
          .            .            .                     .
       Message 3    Message 3    Message 3             Message 3
          .            .            .                     .
          .            .            .                     .
          .            .            .                     .
       Message n    Message n    Message n             Message n
 
To see a list of topics (looking across), you use the DIRECTORY/FOLDER
command. To see a list of messages within a particular topic (looking
down), you use the DIRECTORY command. To move across from one topic to
another, you use the SELECT command. To move up and down within a topic,
you can use the READ, NEXT, BACK, LAST and CURRENT commands.
 
To add a message of your own to the bottom of the current topic, you can
use the ADD command. To add an entirely new topic to the bulletin board,
use the CREATE command.

2.0 General Information
 
The first step in using BULLETIN is to log into the VAX and enter either
 
       BULL name
 
 
 
or
       BULLETIN name
 
In response, you may get a list of topics that have new messages (this
only happens for those topics for which you have requested this
service), and a prompt of the form:
 
       BULL>
 
The topic name will have been selected. If no name is specified on the
BULLetin command, then the GENERAL folder will be selected.
 
One of the following qualifiers may be appended to the BULLETIN command
to select an option for this execution of BULLETIN:
 
       /EDIT      - Specifies that all ADD or REPLACE commands within
                    BULLETIN will use the editor for inputting text.
       /KEYPAD    - Specifies that the keypad mode is set on, such that
                    the keypad keys correspond to BULLETIN commands. See
                    the SET KEYPAD command (section 3.7 below).
       /{NO}PAGE  - Specifies whether BULLETIN will stop outputting
                    after it displays a full screen or not. /PAGE is the
                    default. If /NOPAGE is specified, any output will
                    continue until it is finished.
 
 
At this point, you can enter any of the commands described below. The
command format for BULLETIN is similar to that used by VMS. Commands may
be entered in either upper- or lower-case, and is a fairly free format,
with words and symbols proceeded by and separated by multiple blanks.
The general format of a command is:
 
       command {object} {/qualifiers}
 
The items in braces are optional, depending on the command, and what you
want to do.
 
The object of a command may be a help subject (for the HELP command), a
message number (for the READ command), or a topic name (for some other
commands).
 
Qualifiers are used to modify the action of a particular command. They
follow the object (if any) and are separated from it by a slash.
Individual qualifiers may be abbreviated, and are separated from each
other by slashes, spaces, or commas.
 
Qualifiers and objects can have three general forms:
       qualifier
       NOqualifier
       qualifier=value
The first case turns on a condition that is currently off. An example of
this is /HEADER qualifier on the FILE command. The second case turns off
a condition that is currently off, for example /NOHEADER. The form
qualifier=value is used to specify a single value for that qualifier. An
 
 
example would be DIRECTORY /SINCE=TODAY to list those messages that were
added today.
 
The following are examples of valid BULLETIN commands:
 
       DIRECTORY
       DIRECTORY/FOLD
       SELECT new_list
       HELP SET
       SET SHOWNEW
 
 
3.0 BULLETIN Commands
 
The following sections cover the individual BULLETIN commands in detail,
grouping them by function. To find a specific command, refer to the
command index at the end of this document.
 
In this section, and throughout the rest of this document, the minimum
abbreviation for commands and qualifiers is shown by the upper-case
letters in the command name and qualifier list. The possible qualifiers
for a command follow the command name on the first line.
 
 
3.1 Getting Out of Bulletin and Getting Help
 
 
The commands in this section are used to get out of BULLETIN, and to get
information while inside BULLETIN.
 
 
EXIt or Quit
 
The EXIT command ends the BULLETIN session and returns you to the VMS
operating system.
 
 
Help topic
 
The HELP command can be used within BULLETIN to obtain help on any
topic. This command works in the same manner as the VMS HELP command.
Entering the HELP command without specifying a topic displays a list of
available topics.
 
 
3.2 Finding Out What's in the Bulletin Board
 
The commands in this section are used to get a quick idea of what is
currently in the system, without necessarily reading all the messages.
 
 
DIrectory  /Describe /Folders /Marked /New /SInce=date
           /STart=message_number
 
 
 
The Directory command lists a summary of messages of folders. The
command:
 
       DIRECTORY
 
causes the message number, submittor's name, date, and subject of each
message in the currently selected folder to be displayed. The command:
 
       DIRECTORY name
 
causes first the folder name to be selected then the list of messages to
be displayed.
 
This usually starts with the last message read. To change the starting
point of the list use one of the following:
 
       /MARKED
           to list messages that have been marked (indicated by an
           asterisk). After using /MARKED, in order to see all messages,
           the folder will have to be reselected using the SELECT
           command.
 
       /NEW
           to start the listing of message with the first unread message
 
       /SINCE=date
           to list all messages created on or after the specified 
           date (If no date is specified, the default is TODAY)L
 N
       /START=message_number
           to start the list with the indicated message number.o
 c
To get a list of folders, use the command:
 P
       DIRECTORY /FOLDERSF
 9
This will list the folder name, last message date and number of messages
in the folder for all folders. An asterisk (*) next to the folder name
indicates that there are unread messages in that folder. The command:A
 A
       DIRECTORY /FOLDERS / DESCRIBE
 ,
will cause the list of folders to contain the folder description.
 n
 o
MARK {message-number or numbers}
UNMARK {message-number or numbers}
 .
The MARK command sets a message as having been marked. This can be useda
to mark an important message for later reading. Marked messages ares
displayed with an asterisk in the left hand column of the directoryd
listing. The UNMARK command removes the mark from the specified message.
 t
 s
  
Message numbers are specified for the MARK and UNMARK commands as foro
the COPY and MOVE commands. 
 t
 s
3.3 Moving Around and Reading Messages
 d
Once you find a message that you would like to read, you will need tol
move to that topic, and then position to the message. The SELECT command
is used to change topics, while the rest of the commands in this section
are used to move around within a topic.n
  
 L
SELect folder-name  /Markedo
  
The SELECT command selects a folder of messages. Once a folder has beenm
selected, all commands, i.e. DIRECTORY, READ, etc. will apply only to
only to those messages. The command:
 c
       SELECT old-fold
 o
will position you to the first new message in the folder old-fold.
 s
The complete folder name need not be specified. BULLETIN will try to
find the closest matching name. For example, INFOV can be used for
INFOVAX. Omitting the folder name will select the folder GENERAL which
contains general messages about BULLETIN.a
 1
After selecting a folder, the user will be notified of the number of
unread messages, and the message pointer will be placed at the first
unread message. 
  
The command:
  
       SELECT old-fold /MARKED
  
will cause only marked messages to be selected. After using /MARKED, in 
order to see all messages, the folder will have to be reselected. 
  
 .
[RETURN]
  
Just entering carriage return in response to a BULLETIN prompt will 
cause either the next screen of the current message, or the first screen
of the next message to be displayed. By just entering carriage returns,R
the user can see all parts of all messages in a folder.t
 l
 t
NExt
 k
The NEXT command skips to the next message and displays it. This iso
useful when paging through messages and a particularly long message is
encountered that a user would like to skip over.
 C
 E
 c
 a
CUrrent    /Edit
 s
The CURRENT command displays the beginning of the message that the user 
is currently reading. When in the middle of reading a long message, andA
the user wants to see the first part again, then the CURRENT command can
be entered.
 
The /EDIT qualifier specifies that the editor is to be used to read ther
message. This is useful for scanning a long message.
 a
 
REAd message-number   /Edit /Marked /New /{NO}Page /Since=date
 s
The READ command is used to read a specific message in the current
folder without having to step through the other messages to get to it.
For example, if the DIRECTORY command shows that the current folderL
contains 15 messages, but the user only wants to read message number 12f
then the command: 
  
       READ 12
 B
can be used to read just that message.
 h
NOTE:u
       a)  If you enter a message number greater than the number of 
           messages in the folder, then the last message in the folder
           will be displayed./
 P
       b)  The READ command can be abbreviated by omitting the READ 
           command. i.e. entering the command 2 is equivalent to READ 2.
  
The /EDIT qualifier specifies that the editor will be used to read the
message.
 h
The /MARKED qualifier causes only marked messages to be read. 
 d
The /NEW qualifier specifies that the first unread message is to bel
read.N
 G
The /PAGE qualifier determines what to do when at the end of the page.
If /PAGE is specified (default), BULLETIN will pause when it reaches the
end of a page (screen). If /NOPAGE is specified, the whole message willy
be displayed. This is useful for terminals that can store more than onea
screenful at a time, or have a remote printer.
 d
The /DATE qualifier is used to select the first message created on or 
after the specified date. If no date is specified, the default is TODAY.
  
 i
Last
 e
The LAST command displays the last message in the current folder. 
 o
 n
 a
 e
BAck
 u
The BACK command displays the message preceeding the current message.,
  
 o
3.4 Adding Messages to a Folders
 
So far we have covered the commands that are used to read messages thaty
have been created by other people. The commands in this section are used
to add new messages to a folder, and change messages that already exist.
 a
 s
Add {file-name}   /{NO}EDit /EXpirationtime /NOIndentv
           /SUbject=description /Textr
  
The ADD command adds a message to the specified folder. The command:
 t
       ADD message_file.dat 
 m
will use the contents of the file message_file.dat as the message. The
command:
 o
       ADD
  
will cause BULLETIN to prompt for the text.m
 u
Unless specified by qualifiers, BULLETIN will prompt for an expiration
date, and the message subject.
 /
The /EDIT qualifier determines whether or note to invoke the editor to
edit the message being added. If /EDIT was specified on the BULLETIN
command line, then it is the default, otherwise /NOEDIT is the default.S
 S
The /EXPIRATION qualifier is used to specify the time at which the
message is to expire. Either absolute time: {dd-mm-yyyy} hh:mm:ss, ort
delta time: dddd {hh:mm:ss} can be used. If the time is omitted, thend
the default expiration time for that folder is used. This is normally 15
days.,
 e
The /SUBJECT qualifier can be used to specify the subject of the message
being added.
 t
The /TEXT qualifier specifies that the text of the previously read
message should be included at the beginning of the new message. Then
previous message must be in the same folder. This qualifier is valid
only when used with /EDIT. The text is indented with > at the beginningB
of each line. This indentation can be suppressed with the /NOINDENTN
qualifier.
 t
 s
CHange {file-name}  /{NO}EDit /EXpiration=time /Header /NEw
           /NUmber=message_number /SUbject /Text
 n
 l
 n
The CHANGE command replaces or modifies an existing message. This can be
used to change part or all of a message without causing users who have
already seen it to be notified of it a second time. The command:
 t
       CHANGE message_file.dat
 s
will cause BULLETIN to take the new text of the message from the file,
message_file.dat. The command:
 e
       CHANGE
 
will cause BULLETIN to prompt for the text.I
 =
The expiration date and header can also be changed. If no qualifiers are
specified, then it is assumed that the whole message is to be replaced.O
 
The /EDIT qualifier and the /SUBJECT qualifier behave as in the ADD 
command.
  
The /HEADER qualifier specified that the message header is to be
replaced. The user will be prompted for the new message description.
  
The /NEW qualifier works with the /EDIT qualifier. If /NEW is specified,
then the old message text will not be read into the editor, and as
totally new text will be used.
  
The /NUMBER qualifier specifies the number of the message to bec
replaced. If it is not specified, then the current message will be
altered.
 e
The /TEXT qualifier specifies that the message text is to be replaced.
  
  
DElete {message number}{-message_number1}    /IMmediatei
 n
The DELETE command deletes the specified message. Only the original 
owner can delete a message. 
 a
Note that messages are not deleted immediately, but their expiration is 
set to 15 minutes in the future. This allows a user to recover the
message using the UNDELETE command. If you want the message deletedl
immediately, use the /IMMEDIATE qualifier.
 R
The command:
 
       DELETEi
 t
will delete the current message, while the command:g
 
       DELETE 3 
  
will delete message number 5, and the command:
 n
       DELETE 2-6a
 u
 a
will delete messages 2 to 6 inclusive.
 A
  
UNDelete {message-number}E
 I
The DELETE command (without the /IMMEDIATE qualifier) actually sets the
expiration date for a message to 15 minutes in the future. The UNDELETEb
command can be specified any time within that 15 minutes to roll backa
the deletion process and reset the expiration date to its original
value. 15 minutes after a message has been DELETed, it will have
disappeared, and the UNDELETE command will have no effect.
 f
Deleted messages will be indicated as such by the string 'DELETED' in a 
directory listing.
 m
 s
3.5 Other Commands Affecting Messages
 
This section describes other commands that act on single messages. The
COPY command can be used to copy a message to another folder, the MAIL
command will mail a message to a user and the PRINT command will send it
to a line printer (or laser printer).s
 c
 n
COPY folder-name {message_number}{-message_number1}E
           /Merge /Original 
 h
The COPY command copies a message to another folder without deleting ite
from the current folder. For example:E
  
       COPY new-fold
 
will copy the current message to the folder 'new-fold'. The command:
 l
       COPY new-fold 3-6
 w
will copy messages 3 to 6 inclusive from the current folder to the
folder 'new-fold'.
 T
The /MERGE qualifier causes the original date and time of the copied
messages to be saved and the messages placed in the correcth
chronological order in the new folder. This operation is lengthy if thef
new folder is large.
 h
The /ORIGINAL qualifier specifies that the owner of the copied message
will be the original owner of the message. The default is that the
copied message will be owned by the person copying the message.a
 d
 s
MOVE folder-name {message_number}{-message_number1} 
           /Merge /Originale
 i
The MOVE command copies a message to another folder deleting it from the
current folder. For example:
 r
 t
       MOVE new-fold
 n
will move the current message to the folder 'new-fold'. The command:
 g
       MOVE new-fold 3-6
 t
will move messages 3 to 6 inclusive from the current folder to the
folder 'new-fold'.
 
The /MERGE and /ORIGINAL qualifiers are as for the COPY command.
  
 s
EXTract or FIle {message_number}{-message_number1} file_name
           /All /{NO}Header /New
 e
The EXTRACT or FILE command copies the specified message to the namedU
file. Thus the command:e
 g
       FILE abc.dat 
 t
will copy the current message to the file 'abc.dat', and the command:m
 a
       FILE 1-5 abc.datt
 e
will copy messages 1 to 5 inclusive to the file 'abc.dat'.
 d
If the file exists, the messages are appended to the file, unless ther
/NEW qualifier is specified, which causes a new file to created whetherE
one of the given name exists or not.
 N
The /ALL qualifier causes all messages in the current folder to be
copied to the specified file.w
 o
The /HEADER qualifier controls whether a header containing the owner,,
subject and date of the message is written to the file. The default is
to write the header. Specifying /NOHEADER prevents this header fromc
being written.
  
 A
PRint {message_number}{-message_number1}
           /All /Form /{NO}Header /{NO}NOTifye
           /Queue{=queue_name}
 r
The PRINT command sends a copy of the selected message to a printer. The
command:
  
       PRINT
 d
will send the current message while the command:
 d
       PRINT 3-6
  
will send messages 3 to 6 inclusive.
 o
 n
  
The /ALL qualifier will cause all messages in the current folder to be
printed.
 s
The /FORM qualifier specifies the name or number of the form that youm
want to use for the print job. This corresponds to the /FORM qualifier
in the VMS PRINT command.d
 
The /HEADER qualifier controls whether a header containing the owner,g
subject and date of the message is printed at the beginning. The default
is to write the header. Specifying /NOHEADER will suppress this header.l
 
Specifying the /NOTIFY qualifier indicates that the user will be
notified by a broadcast message, when the message(s) have been printed.l
This is suppressed with the /NONOTIFY qualifier. The default is /NOTIFY.
  
The /QUEUE qualifier specifies the name of the print queue to which theh
message is to be sent. This corresponds to the /QUEUE qualifier on the
VMS PRINT command.
  
 K
3.6 Folder (topic) Managementr
 e
The commands in this section describe how to create and remove a folder,
and change some of the parameters associated with a folder.s
 s
 a
CReate folder_name  /Description=description  /Private
           /SEMIPRIVATEa
 n
The CREATE command creates a folder of messages. Folders in BULLETIN are
similar to folders in the VMS MAIL utility. They are created so that
messages of a similar topic can be grouped together, and/or to restrictf
reading of certain messages to specified users. The command:
 i
       CREATE new-fold
 f
will create a folder named 'new_fold'. Folder names are limited to 25
letters and must not include spaces or characters that are also invalidl
in filenames. This is because the folder is stored in a file nameg
created with the folder name.f
  
If the description of the folder is not specified in the /DESCRIPTIONi
qualifier, BULLETIN will prompt for the folder description.  If thei
folder receives messages from a network mailing list, the address of
that mailing list is included at the end of the description enclosed byi
<>. For example:
 i
     INFOVAX Mailing List   <IN%"INFO-VAX@KL.SRI.COM">
  
In this case, IN%"INFO-VAX@KL.SRI.COM" is the address of the INFO-VAX 
mailing list. Contact the CRNL hotline at CC1::CONSULT or DN 4000 forq
help in setting up such a folder. 
 j
  
 t
The /PRIVATE qualifier specifies that the folder can only be accessed by
users who have been granted access by the SET ACCESS command. See thet
SET ACCESS command (section 3.7) for more details.
 a
The /SEMIPRIVATE qualifier specifies that only specified users (see thes
SET ACCESS command) can add or modify messages in this folder. All users
can read the folder.
 D
 N
MODify     /Description=description /Name=new name
 p
The MODIFY command changes information for the current folder. Only thee
owner of the folder can use this command. 
 m
If the /DESCRIPTION qualifier is not specified, then BULLETIN will
prompt for the new description.r
 h
To change the name of a folder, use the /NAME qualifier.
 h
 o
REMove folder_name
 G
The REMOVE command removes a folder. Only the owner of a folder canh
perform this task.
 ,
 e
3.7 The SET and SHOW Commandse
  
The SET command is used with other commands to define or change=
characteristics of the BULLETIN Utility. The SHOW command is used to
display information about these characteristics.
 s
 e
SET {NO}Access user_id {folder-name}
           /All /ReadT
 a
The SET ACCESS command controls access to a private folder. Such a
folder can be selected only by users who have been granted access by the
owner of the folder.
 e
The user-id can be one or more ids contained in the system RightsI
Database or the name of a file which contains a list of such ids. Theh
Rights Database contains usernames and UICs. For example:N
 E
       SET ACCESS SMITHJ a_folder 
  
will grant access to the folder 'a_folder' to the user 'SMITHJ', and the
command:
 e
       SET ACCESS @list_of_ids.dis
  
will grant access to all the ids listed in the file 'list_of_ids.dis'.
Note that the file name must be proceeded by a '@'.m
 d
 l
 s
The /ALL qualifier causes access to the folder to be granted to alle
users. The command:s
 s
       SET ACCESS private_folder /ALL 
 i
will cause the folder 'private_folder' to be converted to a public
folder; it is accessible by all users. The command:u
 n
       SET ACCESS private_folder /ALL /READ/
 E
will convert the folder 'private_folder' to a semi-private folder. All
users can read messages in it, but only those who have been grantedi
access (by the SET ACCESS command) can add messages to it.
  
The /READ qualifier states that the specified user will be limited to{
only being able to read messages in the folder. 
  
 M
SET {NO}BRief     /Folder=folder_namex
 a
The SET BRIEF command controls whether the user will be alerted upon
logging in that there are new messages in the currently selected folder.
This contrasts with the READNEW and SHOWNEW flags which cause a listing 
of the descriptions of the new messages to be displayed, and in the case
of READNEW, asks the user if he/she wants to read the messages. Settingd
BRIEF will clear a READNEW or SHOWNEW setting (and visa versa).
 
The command:
 m
       SET NOBRIEF /FOLDER=big_folderi
 d
will clear the brief setting for the folder 'big_folder'.O
 c
 a
SET DEfault_expire=daysm
 a
The SET DEFAULT_EXPIRE command sets the default length of time a message
remains in the current folder. When a folder is created, the value is 14
days. The command:
 {
       SET DEFAULT_EXPIRE=30
 E
will cause the default expiration time to be set to 30 days.
 s
  
SET Expire_limit daysu
 e
The SET EXPIRE LIMIT command specifies that maximum expiration that cano
be specified when a user is adding a message to the currently selected
folder.
  
 C
SET {NO}Keypad
SHOW Keypadp
 e

SET {NO}NOTify    /FOlder=folder_namen
 f
The SET NOTIFY controls whether a user will be notified via a broadcasts
message when a message is added to a selected folder. The command:
 H
       SET NOTIFYt
 s
will cause a such a broadcast message to be issued for the currently
selected folder, while the command:l
 s
       SET NONOTIFY/FOLDER=his_foldH
 E
will cause such messages to cease for the folder named 'his_fold'.
 m
 }
SET {NO}PAge
 }
The SET PAGE command specifies whether any directory message listing
will pause when it reaches the end of the page (or screen) or not.
Setting NOPAGE is useful for terminals that can store more than oneu
screenful at a time, and that have a remote printer that can print the
contents of the terminal's memory. The default is PAGE, but this can bee
changed by specifying /NOPAGE on the command used to invoke BULLETIN.p
 f
  
SET {NO}PROmpt_expireh
 o
 t
The PROMPT_EXPIRE specifies that a user will be prompted for an/
expiration date when adding a message. This is the default condition. If
NOPROMPT_EXPIRE is specified for a folder, then users will not beh
prompted when adding a message to that folder, and the default
expiration time (set by a SET DEFAULT_EXPIRE) will be used.
 
This command works only on the currently selected folder, and can be
only be used by folder owner.e

 e
SET {NO}Readnew   /Folder=foldername
 p
If the READNEW flag is set for a folder then whenever a user logs in, aE
list of messages that have been added to that folder since the last log 
in are displayed and the user asked if he/she would like to read them.
The SET READNEW command controls this flag for individual users. The
default setting is usually NOREADNEW, but it can be changed by the owner
of the folder.
  
In order to apply this to a specific folder, first select the folder
(using the SELECT command), and then enter the SET READNEW command.d
 e
If you have several folders with READNEW enabled, each folder's messages
will be displayed separately. However, if you EXIT the READNEW beforeo
all the folders have been displayed, you will not be alerted of the newa
messages in undisplayed folders the next time you login. However, if you
enter BULLETIN, you will be told that new messages are present in thoser
other folders.
 u
The /FOLDER qualifier can be used to specify the folder for which thee
option is to be modified, for the SET NOREADNEW command only. For 
example:
 f
       SET NOREADNEW his_foldi
 o
will clear the READNEW flag for the folder 'his_fold'. The command: 
  
       SET READNEW his_fold
 d
is illegal.e
 g
 f
SET {NO}SHownew   /Folder=folder_name 
 
The SET SHOWNEW command is similar to the SET READNEW command, but only
the directory listing of new messages is displayed at login time. UsersM
are not asked if they want to read the new messages. The command format-
and qualifiers are as for the SET READNEW command.
