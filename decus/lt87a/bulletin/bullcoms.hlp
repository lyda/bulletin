1 ADD
Adds a message to the specified folder.  A file can be specified which
contains the message.  Otherwise, BULLETIN will prompt for the text.
BULLETIN will ask for an expiration date and a header to contain the
topic of the message.

  Format:
    ADD [file-name]

All the qualifiers except for /EDIT and /NODES are restricted to users
with SETPRV privileges.
2 /ALL
This option is restricted to privileged users.  It is used in conjunction
with the /BROADCAST qualifier.  If specified, all terminals are sent the
message.  Otherwise, only users are sent the message.
2 /BELL
This option is restricted to privileged users.  It is used in conjunction 
with the /BROADCAST qualifier.  If specified, the bell is rung on the 
terminals when the message is broadcasted.
2 /BROADCAST
This option is restricted to privileged users.  If specified, message
is both stored and broadcasted to all users logged in at the time.
See also /ALL and /BELL.
2 /EDIT
Determines whether or not the editor is invoked to edit the message
you are adding.  /EDIT is the default if you have added /EDIT to your
BULLETIN command line.
2 /FOLDER=foldername
Specify the folder into which the message is to be added.
2 /NODES=(nodes[,...])
Specifies to send the message to the listed DECNET nodes.  The BULLETIN
utility must be installed properly on the other nodes.  You can specify
a different username to use at the other nodes by either using the
USERNAME qualifier, or by specifying the nodename with 2 semi-colons
followed by the username, i.e. nodename::username.  If you specify a
username, you will be prompted for the password of the account on the
other nodes.
2 /PERMANENT
This option is restricted to privileged users for the GENERAL folder,
but available to all in other folders.  If specified, message will be a
permanent message and will never expire.
2 /SHUTDOWN
This option is restricted to privileged users.  If specified, message
will be automatically deleted after a computer shutdown has occurred.
This option is restricted to the general message file.
2 /SYSTEM
This option is restricted to privileged users.  If specified, message
is both saved in the general folder and displayed in full as a system
message when a user logs in.  System messages should be as brief as possible
to avoid the possibility that system messages could scroll off the screen.
2 /USERNAME
Specifies username to be used at remote DECNET nodes when adding messages
to DECNET nodes via the /NODE qualifier.
1 BACK
Displays the message preceding the current message.
1 BULLETIN
The BULLETIN utility permits a user to create a message for reading by
all users.  Users are notified upon logging in that new messages have
been added, and what the topic of the messages are.  Actual reading of
the messages is optional. (See the command SET READNEW for info on
automatic reading.)  Messages are automatically deleted when their
expiration date has passed.
1 COPY
Copies a message to another folder  without  deleting  it  from  the
current folder.

  Format:

    COPY folder-name
2 /ORIGINAL
Specifies that the owner of the copied message will be the original owner
of the message.  The default is that the copied message will be owned by
the person copying the message.
1 CREATE
Creates a folder of messages.  This is similar to the folders in the VMS
MAIL utility.  Folders are often created so that messages of a similar
topic are grouped seperately, or to restrict reading of certain messages
to specified users.  Once created, that message is automatically selected
(see information on SELECT command).  The commands that can be used to
modify the folder's characteristics are: SET ACCESS, SET BBOARD, REMOVE.

  Format:
    CREATE folder-name

The folder-name is limited to 25 letters and must not include spaces or
characters that are also invalid in filenames (this is because the folder
is stored in a file name created with the folder name).
2 /BRIEF
Specifies that all users automatically have BRIEF set for this folder.
Only a privileged user can use this qualifier.  (See HELP SET BRIEF for
more information.)
2 /NOTIFY
Specifies that all users automatically have NOTIFY set for this folder.
Only a privileged user can use this qualifier.  (See HELP SET NOTIFY for
more information.)
2 /PRIVATE
Specifies that the folder can only be accessed by users who have been
granted access via the SET ACCESS command.  Note: This option uses ACLs
and users who are granted access must be entered into the Rights Data Base.
If the RDB does not exist on your system, a privileged user will have to
create it.  If a user is not in the RDB, this program will automatically
enter the user into it (unless this feature was disabled  during the
compilation of this program).  NOTE: See HELP SET ACCESS for more info.
2 /READNEW
Specifies that all users automatically have READNEW set for this folder.
Only a privileged user can use this qualifier.  (See HELP SET READNEW for
more information.)
2 /SEMIPRIVATE
Similar to /PRIVATE, except that the folder is restricted only with
respect to adding or modifying messages.  All users can read the folder.
1 CURRENT

Displays the beginning of the message you are currently reading.  If
you  are  reading  a long message and want to display the first part
of the message again, you can enter the CURRENT command.

  Format:

    CURRENT
1 DELETE
Deletes the specified message.  If no message is specified, the current
message is deleted.  Only the original owner or a privileged user can
delete a message.

  Format:
    DELETE [message-number]

The message's relative number is found by the DIRECTORY command.
2 /NODES=(nodes[,...])
Specifies to delete the message at the listed DECNET nodes.  The BULLETIN
utility must be installed properly on the other nodes.  You can specify
a different username to use at the other nodes by either using the
USERNAME qualifier, or by specifying the nodename with 2 semi-colons
followed by the username, i.e. nodename::username.  If you specify a
username, you will be prompted for the password of the account on the
other nodes.  The /SUBJECT must be specified to identify the specific
message that is to be deleted.
2 /SUBJECT=subject
Specifies the subject of the bulletin to be deleted at a remote DECNET
node.  The DECNET node must be specified with the /NODE qualifier.
The specified subject need not be the exact subject of the message.
It can be a substring of the subject.  This is in case you have forgotten
the exact subject that was specified.  Case is not critical either.
You will be notified if the deletion was successful.
2 /USERNAME
Specifies username to be used at remote DECNET nodes when deleting messages
on other DECNET nodes via the /NODE qualifier.
1 DIRECTORY
Lists a summary of the messages.  The message number, submitter's name,
date, and subject of each message is displayed.
2 /FOLDERS
Lists the available message folders.
2 /SINCE=date
Displays a listing of all the messages created on or after the
specified date.  If no date is specified, the default is TODAY.
2 /START=start-point
Indicates the first message number you want to display.  For example,
to  display  all the messages beginning with number three, enter the
command line DIRECTORY/START=3.  Not valid with /FOLDER.
1 EXIT
Exits the BULLETIN program.
1 EXTRACT
Synonym for FILE command.
1 FILE
Copies the current message to the named file.  The file-name parameter
is required.  If the file exists, the message is appended to the file,
unless the /NEW qualifier is specified.

  Format:
    FILE file-name
2 /HEADER
 /[NO]HEADER

Controls whether a header containing the owner, subject, and date of the 
message is written in the file.  The default is to write the header.
2 /NEW

Specifies that a new file is to be created.  Otherwise, if the specified
file exists, the file would be appended to that file.
1 Folders
All messages are divided into separate folders.  The default folder is
GENERAL, in which also is stored SYSTEM messages.  New folders can be
created by any user.  As an example, the following creates a folder for
GAMES related messages: 

BULLETIN> CREATE GAMES
Enter a one line description of folder.
GAMES

To see the list of available folders, use DIRECTORY/FOLDERS.  To select
a specific folder, use the SELECT command.  

If a user selects a folder and enters the SET READNEW command, that
user will be alerted of topics of new messages at login time, and will 
then be given the option of reading them.  Note, however, that the display
of topics of new GENERAL folders is not controlled by this command, and
that READNEW is the default for the GENERAL folder.

Instead of SET READNEW, SET BRIEF can be specified, which will only cause
a brief message upon logging in indicating there are new message in the
specified folder.  Additionally, a user can be immediately alerted when a
new message has been added to a folder by the SET NOTIFY command. 

A folder can be restricted to only certain users, if desired.  This is 
done by specifying CREATE/PRIVATE.  Afterwards, access to the folder is 
controller by the creator by the SET [NO]ACCESS command.  If /SEMIPRIVATE
rather than /PRIVATE is specified, all users can read the messages in the
folder, but only those give access can add messages.
1 HELP
To obtain help on any topic, type:

	HELP  topic
1 LAST

Displays the last message in the current folder.

  Format:
       LAST
1 MAIL
Invokes the VAX/VMS Personal Mail Utility (MAIL) to send the message
which you are reading to the specified recipients.

  Format:

    MAIL recipient-name

The input for the recipient name is exactly the same format as used by
the MAIL utility.
2 /SUBJECT

 /SUBJECT=text

Specifies the subject of the mail message. If the text consists of more
than one word, enclose the text in quotation marks (").

If you omit this qualifier, the description of the message will be used
as the subject.
1 MODIFY
Modifies the database information for the current folder.  Only the owner
of the folder or a user with privileges can use this command.

  Format:

    MODIFY
2 /DESCRIPTION
Specifies a new description for the folder.  You will be prompted for
the text of the description.
2 /NAME

  /NAME=foldername

Specifies a new name for the folder.
2 /OWNER

  /OWNER=username

Specifies a new owner for the folder.
1 MOVE
Moves a message to another  folder and deletes it from  the  current
folder.

  Format:

    MOVE folder-name
2 /ORIGINAL
Specifies that the owner of the moved message will be the original owner
of the message.  The default is that the moved message will be owned by
the person moving the message.
1 NEXT
Skips to the next message and displays it.  This is useful when paging
through the messages and you encounter a particularly long message
that you would like to skip over.
1 PRINT
Queues a copy of the message you are currently reading (or have just
read)  for  printing. The PRINT command can take optional qualifiers.

   Format:

       PRINT
2 /HEADER
 /[NO]HEADER

Controls whether a header containing the owner, subject, and date of the 
message is printed at the beginning. The default is to write the header.
2 /NOTIFY
 /[NO]NOTIFY

Indicates that you will be notified by a broadcast message  when  the
file or files have been printed.  If /NONOTIFY is specified, there
is no notification.  The default is /NOTIFY.
2 /QUEUE=queue-name
The name of the queue to which a message is to be sent.  If the /QUEUE
qualifier  is  not  specified,  the message is queued to SYS$PRINT.
1 READ
Displays the specified message.  If you do not specify a message, then
the first time you enter the command, the first message in the folder will
be displayed.  However, if there are new messages, the first new message
will be displayed.  Each time you enter the command, the next page, or if
there are no more pages, the next message will be displayed. 

  Format:
    READ [message-number]

The message's relative number is found by the DIRECTORY command.
If you specify a number greater than the number of messages in the
folder, the last message in the folder will be displayed.

NOTE: The READ command can be abbreviated by omitting the READ command,
i.e. typing the command "2" is equivalent to "READ 2", and simply hitting
the <RETURN> key is equivalent to "READ".
2 /PAGE
 /[NO]PAGE

Specifies that the display of the message will pause when it reaches the
end of the page.  If /NOPAGE is specified, the whole message will be
displayed.  This is useful for terminals that can store more than one
screenful at a time, and that have a remote printer that can then print
the contents of the terminal's memory.
2 /SINCE=date
Specifies to read the first message created on or after the specified
date.  If no date is specified, the default is TODAY.
1 REMOVE
Removes a folder.  Only the owner of a folder or a privileged
user can remove the folder.

  Format:
    REMOVE folder-name
1 REPLACE
Replaces or modifies existing stored message.  This is for changing part
or all of a message without causing users who have already seen the
message to be notified of it a second time.  If the text of the message
is to be changed, a file can be specified which contains the text.
Otherwise, you will be promptted for the text.  The expiration info and
header can also be changed.  If neither no qualifiers are added to the
command, it is assumed the whole message will be replaced.

  Format:
    REPLACE [file-name]
2 /EDIT
Determines whether or not the editor is invoked to edit the message
you are replacing.  The old message text is read into the editor unless
a file-name or /NEW is specified.  /EDIT is the default if you have
added /EDIT to your BULLETIN command line.
2 /EXPIRATION
Specifies that the message expiration date is to be replaced.
2 /GENERAL
Specifies that the message is to be converted from a SYSTEM message to
a GENERAL message.  This only applies to the GENERAL folder.
2 /HEADER
Specifies that the message header is to be replaced.
2 /NEW
If the editor is to be used for replacing the text of the message,
NEW specifies not to read in the old message text, and that a totally
new text is to be read in.
2 /NUMBER=n
Specifies the message number to be replaced.  If this qualifier is 
omitted, the message that is presently being read will be replaced.
2 /PERMANENT
Specifies that the message is to be made permanent.
2 /SHUTDOWN
Specifies that the message is to expire after the next computer
shutdown.  This only applies to general or system messages.
2 /SYSTEM
Specifies that the message is to be made a SYSTEM message.  This is a
privileged command and only applies to the GENERAL folder.
2 /TEXT
Specifies that the message text is to be replaced.
1 RESPOND
Invokes the VAX/VMS Personal Mail Utility (MAIL) to send a reply mail
message to the owner of the currently read message.  If the owner of the
message is not a valid user, it is assumed that the message was from
a network, and the message is searched for a line starting with "From:".
The username is then extracted from that line, and the necessary mail
routine to send over the network is invoked.
2 /SUBJECT

 /SUBJECT=text

Specifies the subject of the mail message. If the text consists of more
than one word, enclose the text in quotation marks (").

If you omit this qualifier, the description of the message will be used
as the subject preceeded by "RE: ".
1 QUIT
Exits the BULLETIN program.
1 SEARCH
Searches the currently selected folder for  the  message  containing
the first occurrence of the specified text string.

   Format:

       SEARCH [search-string]

message searches for the given search-string  in  the  currently
selected  folder.   The  search  starts  from  the  beginning of the
messages in  the  current  folder.   If  a  "search-string"  is  not
specified,  a  search  is  made for the previously specified string,
starting after the message you are currently reading (or  have  just
read).
2 /START

 /SUBJECT=message number

Specifies the message number to start the search at.
1 SELECT
Selects a folder of messages.  See HELP Folders for a description of a
folder.  Once a folder has been selected, all commands, i.e. DIRECTORY,
READ, etc. will apply only to those messages.  Use the CREATE command to
create a folder. Use the DIRECTORY/FOLDER command to see the list of
folders that have been created. 

 Format:

     SELECT [folder-name]

Omitting the folder name will select the default general messages.
1 SET
The SET command is used with other  commands  to  define  or  change
characteristics  of  the  BULLETIN  Utility.

  Format:

    SET option
2 ACCESS
Controls access to a private folder.  A private folder can only be 
selected by users who have been granted access.  Only the owner of that 
folder is allowed to grant access.

  Format:

    SET [NO]ACCESS id [folder-name]

The parameter "id" is the id in the system Rights Database to which
access is being affected.  For more infomation concerning usage of
private folders, see HELP CREATE /PRIVATE.  NOTE: Access is created
by use of ACLs.  If a user is able to set his process's privileges
to override ACLs, that user will be able to access the folder even if
access has not been granted via BULLETIN.  Also note that if a user
logs in after a private folder has been created but before being 
given access, and then is given access, any defaults that the folder
has, i.e. /BRIEF, /READNEW, & /NOTIFY, will not be set for that user.
This is because if the id is not a username, it becomes an extremely
lengthy operation to check each user to see if have that id assigned
to them.  The alternative is to set the defaults for all users after
every SET ACCESS, but that might cause problems with users who have
manually reset those defaults.  The correct solution requires a large
programming modification, which will be done in a later version.
3 /ALL
Specifies that access to the folder is granted to all users, in other
words the folder is made no longer private.  /ALL is specified in
place of the id name after the SET ACCESS command:
    SET ACCESS /ALL [folder-name]
3 /READ
Specifies that access to the folder will be limited to being able to
read the messages.
2 BBOARD
Specifies a username to be used as a BBOARD destination.  Mail which is
sent to that user are converted into messages.  This command will apply
to the selected folder, and each folder can have it's own BBOARD.  If
no folder is selected, the general message file is modified.  Only 
privileged users or owners of the folders can set BBOARD. Note: The
specified account must have the DISUSER flag specified in the system
authorization file, and it either must be given SYSTEM privileges, or
the scratch bboard_directory (specified when compiling BULLETIN) must
have world rwed protection.

  Format:

    SET BBOARD [username]
3 /EXPIRATION
 /EXPIRATION=days
 /NOEXPIRATION

Specifies the number of days the message created by the BBOARD is to be
retained.  The default is 14 days.  The highest limit that can be
specified is 30 days.  This can be overridden by a user with privileges.
If /NOEXPIRATION is specified, messages will become permanent.
3 /SPECIAL
Specifies that the input should be processed using a special command
procedure, and not to use the simple VMS MAIL to message conversion.
Specifying a username is optional.  To remove this feature, you must
either SET NOBBOARD, or SET BBOARD and specify a username.  See
installation notes for exactly how to use this feature.
3 /VMSMAIL
Used in conjunction with /SPECIAL.  If /SPECIAL and a username is
specified, and the conversion still takes it's input from VMS MAIL, then
the VMS system mail file is checked to see if new mail exists for the
specified user before running the command procedure.  This saves time and
avoids creating subprocesses.  (Useful if input is digest format.)
2 BRIEF
Controls whether you will be alerted upon logging that there are new
messages in the currently selected folder.  This cannot be specified for
the GENERAL folder.  The BRIEF setting contrasts with the READNEW
setting, which causes a listing of the description of the new messages
to be displayed and prompts the user to read the messages.  Setting
BRIEF will clear a READNEW setting (and visa versa).

  Format:

    SET [NO]BRIEF
3 /ALL
Specifies that the SET [NO]BRIEF option is the default for all users for
the specified folder.  This is a privileged qualifier.
3 /DEFAULT
Specifies that the [NO]BRIEF option is the default for the specified
folder.  This is a privileged qualifier.  It will only affect brand new
users (or those that have never logged in).  Use /ALL to modify all users.
2 FOLDER
Select a folder of messages.  Identical to the SELECT command.  See help
on that command for more information.

  Format:

    SET FOLDER [folder-name]
2 LOGIN
Controls whether the specified user will be alerted of any messages,
whether system or non-system, upon logging in.  If an account has the
DISMAIL flag set, SET NOLOGIN is automatically applied to that account
during the first time that the account logs in.  However, this will
not occur if DISMAIL is set for an old account.  Additionally, removing
the DISMAIL flag will not automatically enable LOGIN.  (The reason for
the above was to avoid extra overhead for constant checking for the
DISMAIL flag.)

  Format:

    SET [NO]LOGIN [username]
2 NOTIFY
Specifies whether you will be notified via a broadcast message when a
message is added to the selected folder.

  Format:

    SET [NO]NOTIFY
3 /ALL
Specifies that the SET [NO]NOTIFY option is the default for all users for
the specified folder.  This is a privileged qualifier.
3 /DEFAULT
Specifies that the [NO]NOTIFY option is the default for the specified
folder.  This is a privileged qualifier.  It will only affect brand new
users (or those that have never logged in).  Use /ALL to modify all users.
2 PRIVILEGES
Specifies the privileges that are necessary to use privileged commands.
Use the SHOW PRIVILEGES command to see what privileges are presently set.
This is a privileged command.

  Format:

    SET PRIVILEGES privilege-list

Privilege-list is the list of privileges seperated by commas. 
To remove a privilege, specify the privilege preceeded by "NO".
2 READNEW
Controls whether you will be prompted upon logging in if you wish to read 
new non-system or folder messages (if any exist).  The default is that you
are prompted.  In order to apply this to a specific folder, first select
the folder (using the SELECT command), and then enter the READNEW command.
For messages in folders other than the GENERAL folder, both prompting 
and display of topics of new messages are controlled by this command.

  Format:

    SET [NO]READNEW
3 /ALL
Specifies that the SET [NO]READNEW option is the default for all users for
the specified folder.  This is a privileged qualifier.
3 /DEFAULT
Specifies that the [NO]READNEW option is the default for the specified
folder.  This is a privileged qualifier.  It will only affect brand new
users (or those that have never logged in).  Use /ALL to modify all users.
1 SHOW
The SHOW command displays information about certain characteristics.
2 BRIEF
Shows whether BRIEF has been set for this folder. (See HELP SET BRIEF).
2 FOLDER
Shows information about a folder of messages.  Owner and description are
shown.  If the folder name is omitted, and a folder has been selected via
the SELECT command, information about that folder is shown.

  Format:

    SHOW FOLDER [folder-name]
3 /FULL
Controls whether the access list and the BBOARD information for the
folder is displayed.  This infomation is only those who have access to
that message.
2 NEW
Shows folders which have new unread messages for which BRIEF or READNEW
have been set.  (Note: If you enter BULLETIN but do not read new unread
messages, you will not be notified about them the next time you enter
BULLETIN.  This is a design "feature" and cannot easily be changed.)
2 NOTIFY
Shows whether NOTIFY has been set for this folder. (See HELP SET NOTIFY).
2 PRIVILEGES
Shows the privileges necessary to use privileged commands.
2 READNEW
Shows whether READNEW has been set for this folder. (See HELP SET READNEW).
