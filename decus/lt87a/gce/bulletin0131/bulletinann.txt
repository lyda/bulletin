You are about to receive version 1.31 of the PFC BULLETIN.  This software is
public domain.  (I will gladly accept recommendations for new features, not
for changes that are due to "personal" preference.)

(The latest feature and bug fixes for this new version are listed later.)

You will be receiving 11 files:
	1) BULLETIN.FOR
	2) BULLETIN0.FOR
	3) BULLETIN1.FOR
	4) BULLETIN2.FOR
	5) BULLETIN3.FOR
	6) BULLETIN4.FOR
	7) BULLETIN5.FOR
	8) BULLETIN6.FOR
	9) ALLMACS.MAR
	10) BULLCOMS.HLP
	11) BULLET.COM
	(They will be indentified in the SUBJECT header.)
BULLET.COM is a command procedure which when run, will create several small
files.  After you run it, you can delete it.
Read AAAREADME.TXT for installation instructions.

NOTE: When creating these files (using the EXTRACT command) from the VMS MAIL
utility, you will have to strip off any mail headers that are present, including
blank lines.  A command procedure is included at this end of this message which
can be run which uses EDT to do this for you.

SECOND NOTE: The feature which allows setting up folders to be publicly
readable but with limited access for writing requires at least VMS VERSION 4.4,
as the code uses a new system service $CHECK_ACCESS.  The code is in
BULLETIN4.FOR, and instructions are there for how to comment it out if you are
running an earlier version.  This will simply cause the feature to be disabled.
Creating fully private folders will still be possible (i.e. limited access for
both reading and writing). 

I've had various problems sending files to certain sites.  I've had to reduce
file sizes in order to transfer the files, and more reduction may be necessary.
BITNET sites are being sent files without any TABs, as TABs were getting
converted to 4 spaces.  Please let me know of any sites which have similar
problems (or any other type, for that matter).  Thank you.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following is a description of recent new features and bug fixes.

V1.0

One is now able to increase the limit of the number folders to whatever you
want rather than the previous limit of 64.  However, changing the limit
requires rebuilding the executable.

/VMSMAIL added to use with  SET BBOARD/SPECIAL to check if there is VMS MAIL
before running special command procedure.  This saves time and avoids
needless subprocess creation.

EXTRACT command added as synonym command to FILE (for compatibility).  Also
/NEW qualifier added to create new file rather than appending to existing file.

CREATE/BRIEF did not work properly.  Although SHOW BRIEF would show that BRIEF
was set, in reality it was not.  Note that help for these two commands were
also omitted.

V1.1

Removed restriction that prevented GENERAL folder from being set to PRIVATE
or SEMIPRIVATE.

Fixed bugs with regards to PRIVATE folders.  If it had /BRIEF or /READNEW
defaults, a user without the ability to access that folder would get access
violation when logging in.  Also, if /NOTIFY was a default, the user would get
notified.  These have been fixed.  Also, a bug which caused a crash when
attempting to MOVE a message to a PRIVATE folder has been fixed. 

Access to private folders besides being allowed via SET ACCESS commands,
is now allowed based on process privileges.  Previously, access was allowed
based on the UAF authorized privileges rather than process privileges.

Made MODIFY/OWNER a privileged command.  Also, modifying ownership of a private
bulletin has been corrected.  Previously, it did not change access correctly.
It now removes access from the old user and adds access to the new user.

Allow the CREATE command to become privileged command via change in BULLCOM.CLD.

Add /FOLDER qualifier to ADD command.

Modified algorithm which deleted non-existant users from user data file when
new user logged in.  For large databases, this was taking a long time, and
in fact was not very useful.

Add /EDIT qualifier to BULLETIN command, similar to MAIL/EDIT, to cause /EDIT
to be the default for ADD & REPLACE commands.

EX command is equal to EXIT, and is not flagged as being ambiguous (due to
conflict with EXTRACT command added in V1.0).

Fixed bug which caused incorrect notification of new messages in folders.
Situation occurred if new message expired after user logged in.  BULLETIN
would notify user that new message existed, and would place user at a
message that the user had already read.

In login display, add line of minus signs to separate SYSTEM messages.
(This can be disabled if desired by modifying BULLMAIN.CLD).

Fixed (?) bugs which prevented proper file conversion from older versions of
BULLETIN (circa 1985).

V1.2

Added SHOW NEW command to show folders with unread new messages.  This is
useful if you enter BULLETIN and are notified that there are new messages
in certain folder, and later in the session which to show which folders
still have unread messages.

CREATE/BRIEF should have been a privileged command, but was not.  It is
now privileged.

The /ALL qualifier has been added to the SET BRIEF/NOTIFY/READNEW command.
It will modify the option for the selected option for all users.  This is
in contrast to /DEFAULT, which would only modify the default for new users.
This is a privileged command.

When reading messages, the name of the folder is displayed on the top line
at the upper right hand corner (similar to MAIL).

V1.3

Fixed bug introduced in V1.1 that would put wrong subject in MOVED message.

/EDIT feature now correctly recognizes MAIL$EDIT definitions of CALLABLE_EDT
and CALLABLE_TPU.

Messages sent via BBOARD that have lines containing greater than 80 characters
are now broken into separate lines rather than truncated.

V1.31

SEARCH did not work as advertised.  It would start the search at the currently
read message rather than at the beginning of the folder.  This has been fixed.
Additionally, a /START qualifier has been added to the command.
