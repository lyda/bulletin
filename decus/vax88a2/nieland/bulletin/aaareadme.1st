The following are instructions for creating and installing the BULLETIN
utility. None of the command procedures included here are sophisticated, so it
is likely that several modifications will have to be made by the installer.
The installer should enable all privileges before installation.

1) CREATE.COM
   This will compile and link the BULLETIN sources. Also, there are several
   INCLUDE files for the fortran sources (.INC files). BULLFILES.INC must first
   be modified before this procedure is run. It contains the names of data files
   which BULLETIN creates. It also includes specifications of directories used
   by the FOLDER and BBOARD features. (In relation to the FOLDER feature, you
   can restrict FOLDER creation to privileged users.  See BULLCOM.CLD).
   You should also look at BULLFOLDER.INC, as there may be some parameters in
   that you may or may not want to modify.

   NOTE 1: If you elect to have folders with the BBOARD feature that receives
   messages from outside networks, and wish the RESPOND command to be able
   to send messages to the originators of these messages, you must modify
   the subroutine RESPOND in BULLETIN2.FOR in order to specify the mail
   utility which you use to send mail over those networks.

   NOTE 2: The maximum number of folders for this distribution is 96 folders.
   If you wish to increase this, modify BULLUSER.INC and recompile the sources.
   When the new executable is run, it will create a new BULLUSER.DAT data file
   and rename the old one to BULLUSER.OLD.  You cannot reduce the number of
   folders.

2) INSTALL.COM
   The following procedure copies the executable image to SYS$SYSTEM and
   installs it with certain privileges.  It also installs the necessary
   help files in SYS$HELP.  (BULLETIN help file is installed into the
   system help library HELPLIB.HLB.  If you don't wish this done, delete
   or modify the appropriate line in the procedure.  Also, the help
   library for the BULLETIN program, BULL.HLB, can be moved to a different
   directory other than SYS$HELP.  If this is done, the system logical name
   BULL_HELP should be defined to be the directory where the library is
   to be found.)

3) LOGIN.COM
   This contains the commands that should be executed at login time
   by SYS$MANAGER:SYLOGIN.COM.  It defines the BULLETIN commands.
   It also executes the command BULLETIN/LOGIN in order to notify
   the user of new messages.  NOTE: If you wish the utility to be a
   different name than BULLETIN, you should modify this procedure.
   The prompt which the utility uses is named after image executable.
   If you want messages displayed upon logging in starting from
   oldest to newest (rather than newest to oldest), add /REVERSE to
   the BULLETIN/LOGIN command.  (WARNING: Finding the newest unread
   message is quicker than finding the oldest unread message.  This
   is not a problem if the number of messages is small.  However,
   if you plan on having lots of messages, and your system is heavily
   loaded, you may want to avoid /REVERSE.  Trial & error is the only
   way to find out if this is a problem!) Note that users with the DISMAIL
   flag setting in the authorization file will not be notified of
   new messages.  See help on the SET LOGIN command within the BULLETIN
   utility for more information on this.

   If you want SYSTEM messages, i.e. messages which are displayed in full
   when logging in, to be continually displayed for a period of time rather
   than just once, you should add the /SYSTEM= qualifier.  This is documented
   in BULLETIN.HLP, although there it is referred to only with respect to
   a user wanting to review system messages.  It can be added with /LOGIN.
   (This is a new feature added as of Version 1.5).

4) BULLSTART.COM
   This procedure contains the commands that should be executed after
   a system startup.  It should be executed by SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP.COM.
   It installs the BULLETIN utility with correct privileges.  It also
   includes the command BULLETIN/STARTUP.  This starts up a detached process
   with the name BULLCP.  It periodically check for expire messages, cleanup
   empty space in files, and converts BBOARD mail to messages.  It also allows
   other DECNET nodes to share it's folders.  If you don't want this feature
   and don't plan on having multiple folders or make use of BBOARD, you could
   eliminate this command if you like.

   If you are installing BULLETIN on a cluster and plan to have the bulletin
   files be shared between all of the cluster nodes, you only need to have
   this process running on one node. On all other nodes, the system logical
   name BULL_BULLCP should be defined (to anything you want) so as to notify
   BULLETIN that BULLCP is running. (On the local node where BULLCP is running,
   this logical name is automatically defined.)

5) BULLETIN.COM
   If one wants BULLETIN to be able to send messages to other DECNET
   node's GENERAL folder, but wants to avoid running the process created
   by BULLETIN/STARTUP on this node, another method exists.  This is the
   "older" (and slower) method.  BULLETIN.COM must be put in each node's
   DECNET default user's directory (usually [DECNET]).  Once this is done,
   the /NODE qualifier for the ADD & DELETE commands can be used.
   NOTE:  Privileged functions such as /SYSTEM will work on other nodes
   if you have an account on the other node with appropriate privileges.
   You will be prompted for the password for the account on the remote node.

6) INSTRUCT.COM
   This procedure adds 2 permanent messages which give a very brief
   description about the BULLETIN utility, and how to turn off optional
   prompting of non-system messages (via SET NOREADNEW).

7) BOARD_SPECIAL.COM
   This command procedure describes and illustrates how to use the
   SET BBOARD/SPECIAL feature.  This feature allows the use of BBOARD
   where the input does not come from VMS MAIL.  For example, this could
   be used in the case where mail from a non-DEC network is not stored
   in the VMS MAIL.  Another example is BOARD_DIGEST.COM.  This file
   takes mail messages from "digest" type mailing lists and splits them
   into separate BULLETIN messages for easier reading.

   To use this feature, place the special command procedure into the
   bulletin file directory using the name BOARD_SPECIAL.COM.  If you want
   to have several different special procedure, you should name the command
   procedure after the username specified by the SET BBOARD command.
