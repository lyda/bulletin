1 POST
Sends a message via MAIL to the network mailing list which is
associated with the selected folder.  This command is used in
conjunction with a folder which receives messages from a network
mailing list.  The address of the mailing list must be stored using
either CREATE/DESCRIPTION or MODIFY/DESCRIPTION.  See help on those
commands for more information.
2 /CC
 /CC=user[s]
Specifies additional users that should receive the mail message.
2 /EDIT
Specifies that the editor is to be used for creating the mail message.
2 /NOINDENT
See /TEXT for information on this qualifier.
2 /SUBJECT
 /SUBJECT=text

Specifies the subject of the mail message. If the text consists of more
than one word, enclose the text in quotation marks (").

If you omit this qualifier, you will prompted for the subject.
2 /TEXT
Specifies that the text of the message that is being read should be
included in the mai message.  This qualifier is valid only when used
with /EDIT.  The text of the message is indented with > at the
beginning of each line.  This can be suppressed with /NOINDENT.
1 PRINT
Queues a copy of the message you are currently reading (or have just
read)  for  printing. The PRINT command can take optional qualifiers.

   Format:

       PRINT [message_number][-message_number1]

A range of messages to be printed can optionally be specified, i.e.
FILE 2-5.
2 /ALL
Prints all the messages in the current folder.
2 /FORM
Specifies the name or number of the form that you want for the print
job.  Codes for form types are installation-defined.  You can use the
SHOW QUEUE/FORM command at DCL level to find out the form types
available for your system.  Use the SHOW QUEUE/FULL command at DCL
level to find out the name of the mounted form and the default form for
a particular queue.  If you specify a form whose stock is different
from the stock of the form mounted on the queue, your job is placed in
a pending state until the stock of the mounted form of the queue is
set equal to the stock of the form associated with the job.  (In order
to have your job print, the system manager should stop the queue,
physically change the paper stock on the output device, and restart the
queue specifying the new form type as the mounted form.)
2 /HEADER
 /[NO]HEADER

Controls whether a header containing the owner, subject, and date of the 
message is printed at the beginning. The default is to write the header.
2 /NOTIFY
 /[NO]NOTIFY

Indicates that you will be notified by a broadcast message  when  the
file or files have been printed.  If /NONOTIFY is specified, there
is no notification.  The default is /NOTIFY.
2 /QUEUE
 /QUEUE=queue_name

The name of the queue to which a message is to be sent.  If the /QUEUE
qualifier  is  not  specified,  the message is queued to SYS$PRINT.
1 READ
Displays the specified message.  If you do not specify a message, then
the first time you enter the command, the first message in the folder will
be displayed.  However, if there are new messages, the first new message
will be displayed.  Each time you enter the command, the next page, or if
there are no more pages, the next message will be displayed. 

  Format:
    READ [message-number]

The message's relative number is found by the DIRECTORY command.
If you specify a number greater than the number of messages in the
folder, the last message in the folder will be displayed.

NOTE: The READ command can be abbreviated by omitting the READ command,
i.e. typing the command "2" is equivalent to "READ 2", and simply hitting
the <RETURN> key is equivalent to "READ".
2 /EDIT
Specifies that the editor is to be used to read the message.  This is
useful for scanning a long message.
2 /MARKED
Selects messages that have been marked (indicated by an asterisk).
After using /MARKED, in order to see all messages, the folder will have
to be reselected using the SELECT command.
2 /NEW
Specifies to read the first unread message.
2 /PAGE
 /[NO]PAGE

Specifies that the display of the message will pause when it reaches the
end of the page.  If /NOPAGE is specified, the whole message will be
displayed.  This is useful for terminals that can store more than one
screenful at a time, and that have a remote printer that can then print
the contents of the terminal's memory.
2 /SINCE
 /SINCE=date

Specifies to read the first message created on or after the specified
date.  If no date is specified, the default is TODAY.
1 REMOVE
Removes a folder.  Only the owner of a folder or a privileged
user can remove the folder.

  Format:
    REMOVE folder-name
1 REPLY
Adds message with subject of message being the subject of the currently
read message with "RE:" preceeding it.  Format and qualifiers is exactly
the same as the ADD command except for /NOINDENT and /TEXT.
2 /NOINDENT
See /TEXT for information on this qualifier.
2 /TEXT
Specifies that the text of the message should be included in the reply
mail message.  This qualifier is valid only when used with /EDIT.  The
text of the message is indented with > at the beginning of each line.
This can be suppressed with /NOINDENT.
1 RESPOND
Invokes the VAX/VMS Personal Mail Utility (MAIL) to send a reply mail
message to the owner of the currently read message.
2 /CC
 /CC=user[s]
Specifies additional users that should receive the reply.
2 /EDIT
Specifies that the editor is to be used for creating the reply mail
message.
2 /LIST
Specifies that the reply should also be sent to the network mailing list
associated with the folder.  The mailing list address should be stored
in the folder description.  See CREATE/DESCRIPTION or MODIFY/DESCRIPTION
for more informaton.
2 /NOINDENT
See /TEXT for information on this qualifier.
2 /SUBJECT
 /SUBJECT=text

Specifies the subject of the mail message. If the text consists of more
than one word, enclose the text in quotation marks (").

If you omit this qualifier, the description of the message will be used
as the subject preceeded by "RE: ".
2 /TEXT
Specifies that the text of the message should be included in the reply
mail message.  This qualifier is valid only when used with /EDIT.  The
text of the message is indented with > at the beginning of each line.
This can be suppressed with /NOINDENT.
1 QUIT
Exits the BULLETIN program.
1 SEARCH
Searches the currently selected folder for  the  message  containing
the first occurrence of the specified text string.

   Format:

       SEARCH [search-string]

The search starts from the first message in the current folder.  The
search includes both the text of the message, and the description header.
If a "search-string" is not specified, a search is made using the
previously specified string, starting with the message following the
one you are currently reading (or have just read).  Once started, a
search can be aborted by typing a CTRL-C.
2 /START
 /START=message_number

Specifies the message number to start the search at.
2 /SUBJECT
Specifies that only the subject of the messages are to be searched.
1 SELECT
Selects a folder of messages.  See HELP Folders for a description of a
folder.  Once a folder has been selected, all commands, i.e. DIRECTORY,
READ, etc. will apply only to those messages.  Use the CREATE command to
create a folder.  Use the DIRECTORY/FOLDER command to see the list of
folders that have been created. 

 Format:

     SELECT [node-name::][folder-name]

The complete folder name need not be specified.  BULLETIN will try to
find the closest matching name.  I.e. INFOV can be used for INFOVAX.

Omitting the folder name will select the default general messages.

The node name can be specified only if the remote node has the special
BULLCP process running (invoked by BULLETIN/STARTUP command.).

After selecting a folder, the user will notified of the number of unread
messages, and the message pointer will be placed at the first unread
message.
2 /MARKEDV
Selects only messages that have been marked (indicated by an asterisk).
After using /MARKED, in order to see all messages, the folder will have
to be reselected.h
1 SETt
The SET command is used with other  commands  to  define  or  change
characteristics  of  the  BULLETIN  Utility.

  Format:s

    SET option
2 ACCESS
Controls access to a private folder.  A private folder can only be  
selected by users who have been granted access.  Only the owner of that 
folder is allowed to grant access.

  Format:i

    SET [NO]ACCESS id-name [folder-name]

The id-name can be one or more ids from the system Rights Database
for which access is being modified.  It can also be a file name whichp
contains a list of ids.  For more information concerning usage ofr
private folders, see HELP CREATE /PRIVATE.  NOTE: Access is createdu
via ACLs.  If a user's process privileges are set to override ACLs,p
that user will be able to access the folder even if access has not
been granted. 
3 id
The id-name can be one or more ids contained in the system Rightsx
Database.  This includes usernames and UICs.  A UIC that contains 
a comma must be enclosed in quotes.  UICs can contain wildcards,
i.e. "[130,*]".  Note that by default, a process is given thef
process rights id SYS$NODE_nodename, where nodename is the decnet 
nodename.  Thus, by specifing this id, a folder can be restricteda
to a specific node, which is useful when the folder is shared amongE
nodes in a cluster.s

Alternatively, the id-name can be a filename which contains a list
of ids.  The filename should be preceeded by a "@".  If the suffix
is not specified, it will be assumed that the suffix is ".DIS" .
3 /ALL
Specifies that access to the folder is granted to all users.
If /READ is not specified, the folder will no longer be private.
If /READ is specified, all users will have read access, but only
privileged users will have write access (of course non-privilegedr
users can gain access via a later SET ACCESS command.)

Format:n

    SET ACCESS /ALL [folder-name]t
3 /READd
Specifies that access to the folder will be limited to being able to
read the messages.
3 Warningv
If a user logs in after a private folder has been created but before
being given access, and then is given access, any defaults that theu
folder has, i.e. /BRIEF, /READNEW, & /NOTIFY, will not be set for that
user. This is because if the id is not a username, it becomes an
extremely lengthy operation to check each user to see if have that id 
assigned to them.  The alternative is to set the defaults for all users 
after every SET ACCESS, but that might cause problems with users who
have manually reset those defaults.  The correct solution requires a
large programming modification, which will be done in a later version. u
2 BBOARD
Specifies a username to be used as a BBOARD destination.  Mail which is 
sent to that user are converted into messages.  This command will applya
to the selected folder, and each folder can have its own BBOARD.  Only c
privileged users or owners of the folders can set BBOARD.  Note: The
specified account must have the DISUSER flag specified in the system
authorization file, and it either must be given SYSPRV privileges, orr
the scratch bboard_directory (specified when compiling BULLETIN) must[
have world rwed protection.  Also, certain system parameters which affect 
detached subprocesses are usually too low for the subprocess which
is spawned to read the mail.  The parameters and the suggested values are:
PQL_DPGFLQUOTA = 10000, PQL_DWSQUOTA = 500, and PQL_DFILLM = 30.  If you
are not using the BULLCP process, the subprocess limit for users must be
at least 2. 

  Format:t

    SET BBOARD [username]f

BBOARD cannot be set for remote folders.  See also the commands SET STRIPs
and SET DIGEST for options on formatting BBOARD messages. 
3 /EXPIRATIONd
 /EXPIRATION=dayss
 /NOEXPIRATION

Specifies the number of days the message created by the BBOARD is to bee
retained.  The default is 14 days.  The highest limit that can bei
specified is 30 days.  This can be overridden by a user with privileges.
If /NOEXPIRATION is specified, messages will become permanent.

NOTE: This value is the same value as specified by SET DEFAULT_EXPIRE.
If one is changed, the other will change also.
3 /SPECIAL
Specifies that the input should be processed using a special command
procedure, and not to use the simple VMS MAIL to message conversion.
Specifying a username is optional.  To remove this feature, you must
either SET NOBBOARD, or SET BBOARD and specify a username.  See 
installation notes for exactly how to use this feature.s
3 /VMSMAIL
Used in conjunction with /SPECIAL.  If /SPECIAL and a username iss
specified, and the conversion still takes its input from VMS MAIL, thend
the VMS system mail file is checked to see if new mail exists for theh
specified user before running the command procedure.  This saves time ande
avoids creating subprocesses.  (Useful if input is digest format.)
3 More_information

The following is relevant only if the messages in the BBOARD accountsl
are sent via a method that causes the name of the account to be placed
in the TO: line of the VMS MAIL.  The normal MAIL utility, of course,N
does this.  However, packages such as PMDF (and probably many others)d
will not always do this.  (I.e. if the mail was sent to the account
using CC:, the address of the person to whom the mail was sent will be
placed in the TO: line rather than the CC: address.)

If more than one folder is to have a BBOARD setting, only one of the
BBOARD names need be a real account.  All other names could be names
whose mail is forwarded to the real account.  BULLETIN will then
determine from the mail header which folder the mail is to be sent to.
Forwarding can be enabled for any name within MAIL by the command:

    MAIL> SET FORWARD/USER=from_name to_name

Any mail sent to FROM_NAME will be forwarded to TO_NAME.  Thus, only
TO_NAME need be a real account.  For example, if you have INFOVAX andq
LASER-LOVERS folders, you need create only a INFOVAX account, and then
forward LASER-LOVERS mail to INFOVAX within mail using the command SET
FORWARD/USER=LASER-LOVERS INFOVAX.  You would then do a SET BBOARD
INFOVAX for the INFOVAX folder, and SET BBOARD LASER-LOVERS for thei
LASER-LOVERS folder.  This method will speed up the BBOARD conversion,
since mail need be read only from one account.  NOTE: Folders that havet
the /SPECIAL set on their BBOARD accounts cannot have their mail forwarded
to BBOARD accounts that don't have /SPECIAL set.  Folders of the same
type, i.e. that use the same /SPECIAL command procedure, must be grouped
separately.e
2 BRIEFe
Controls whether you will be alerted upon logging that there are new
messages in the currently selected folder.  This cannot be specified for
the GENERAL folder.  The BRIEF setting contrasts with the READNEW 
setting, which causes a listing of the description of the new messages
to be displayed and prompts the user to read the messages.  Setting 
BRIEF will clear a READNEW setting (and visa versa).

  Format:o

    SET [NO]BRIEFe
3 /ALL
Specifies that the SET [NO]BRIEF option is the default for all users for
the specified folder.  This is a privileged qualifier.
3 /DEFAULT
Specifies that the [NO]BRIEF option is the default for the specified
folder.  This is a privileged qualifier.  It will only affect brand newT
users (or those that have never logged in).  Use /ALL to modify all users.
3 /FOLDER
   /FOLDER=foldername:

Specifies the folder for which the option is to modified.  If notL
specified, the selected folder is modified. Valid only with NOBRIEF.
2 DEFAULT_EXPIRE
Specifies the number of days the message created by BBOARD (or direct
PMDF path) is to be retained.  The default is 14 days.  The highest limitU
that can be specified is 30 days.  This can be overridden by a user with
privileges.r

This also specifies the default expiration date when adding a message.
If no expiration date is entered when prompted for a date, or if
prompting has been disabled via SET NOPROMPT_EXPIRE, this value will
be used.

  Format:E

    SET DEFAULT_EXPIRE days,

If -1 is specified, messages will become permanent.  If 0 is specified, 
no default expiration date will be present.  The latter should never beU
specified for a folder with a BBOARD, or else the messages will disappear.

NOTE: This value is the same value that SET BBOARD/EXPIRATION specifies.
If one is changed, the other will change also.
2 DIGEST
Affect only messages which are added via either the BBOARD option, ore
written directly from a network mailing program (i.e. PMDF).  Severalg
mailing lists use digest format to send their messages, i.e. the
messages are concatenated into one long message.  If DIGEST is set,c
the messages will be separated into individual BULLETIN messages. 

  Format:a

    SET [NO]DIGEST

The command SHOW FOLDER/FULL will show if DIGEST has been set.

2 DUMP
Specifies that messages deleted from the selected folder are written
into a dump (or log) file.  The name of the log file is foldername.LOG,e
and it is located in the folder directory.

  Format: 

    SET [NO]DUMP

The command SHOW FOLDER/FULL will show if dump has been set.
(NOTE: SHOW FOLDER/FULL is a privileged command.)c
2 EXPIRE_LIMIT
Specifies expiration limit that is allowed for messages.  Non-privileged
users cannot specify an expiration that exceeds the number of days
specified.  Privileged users can exceed the limit.

    SET [NO]EXPIRE_LIMIT [days]i

The command SHOW FOLDER/FULL will show the expiration limit, if one exists. 
(NOTE: SHOW FOLDER/FULL is a privileged command.)d
2 FOLDER
Select a folder of messages.  Identical to the SELECT command.  See help
on that command for more information./

  Format:p

    SET FOLDER [node-name::][folder-name].
3 /MARKEDi
Selects messages that have been marked (indicated by an asterisk).
After using /MARKED, in order to see all messages, the folder will havec
to be reselected. 
2 GENERICa
Specifies that the given account is a "generic" account, i.e used by many 
different people.  If an account is specified as GENERIC, new messages
placed in the GENERAL folder will be displayed upon logging in for a
specific number of days, rather than only once.  The default period is 7
days.  This command is a privileged command.

  Format:Y

    SET [NO]GENERIC username
3 /DAYS 
 /DAYS=number_of_dayst

Specifies the number days that new GENERAL messages will be displayedr
for upon logging in.
2 KEYPAD
Controls whether the keypad has been enabled such that the keys on the
keypad correspond to command definitions.  These definitions can be seen
via the SHOW KEYPAD command.  The default is NOKEYPAD unless the /KEYPAD
qualifier has been added to the BULLETIN command line.

  Format:D

    SET [NO]KEYPAD
2 LOGINe
Controls whether the specified user will be alerted of any messages,
whether system or non-system, upon logging in.  If an account has the 
DISMAIL flag set, SET NOLOGIN is automatically applied to that account
during the first time that the account logs in.  However, this willt
not occur if DISMAIL is set for an old account.  Additionally, removingt
the DISMAIL flag will not automatically enable LOGIN.  (The reason for
the above was to avoid extra overhead for constant checking for thei
DISMAIL flag.)  This command is a privileged command.a

  Format:s

    SET [NO]LOGIN username
2 NODE
Modifies the selected folder from a local folder to a remote folder.
A remote folder is a folder in which the messages are actually storedF
on a folder at a remote DECNET node.  The SET NODE command specifies
the name of the remote node, and optionally the name of the remote
folder.  If the remote folder name is not included, it is assumed to
be the same as the local folder.  When the command is executed, the 
selected folder will then point to the remote folder.  If there were
messages in the local folder, they will be deleted.  This feature is
present only if the BULLCP process is running on the remote node.

  Format:3
    SET NODE nodename [remotename]
    SET NONODE

NOTE: If one node adds a message to a remote node, other nodes connected
to the same folder will not immediately be aware of the new message.
This info is updated every 15 minutes, or if a user accesses that folder.t
3 /FOLDERo
   /FOLDER=foldernamea

Specifies the folder for which the node information is to modified.a
If not specified, the selected folder is modified.
2 NOTIFY
Specifies whether you will be notified via a broadcast message when aa
message is added to the selected folder.

  Format: 

    SET [NO]NOTIFY

This command does not presently work for remote folders.

In a cluster, if the logical name MAIL$SYSTEM_FLAGS is defined so that
bit 1 is set, users will be notified no matter which node they are loggedi
in to.  If you wish to disable this, you should define BULL_SYSTEM_FLAGS
so that bit 1 is cleared.t
3 /ALL
Specifies that the SET [NO]NOTIFY option is the default for all users foro
the specified folder.  This is a privileged qualifier.

If cluster notification is set, users will not be able to disableo
notification for themselves.  This is because VMS is unable to find out 
user names logged in at other nodes, which requires BULLETIN to keep a
list of users to notify.  If /ALL is specified, the list may be very
large, which would cause the notification process to take a very longt
time.  It is much easier to simply notify all users.  However, this can 
be overriden by the /NOCLUSTER qualifier, which will cause the list to
be generated.a
3 /DEFAULT
Specifies that the [NO]NOTIFY option is the default for the specifiedo
folder.  This is a privileged qualifier.  It will only affect brand new 
users (or those that have never logged in).  Use /ALL to modify all users.

If cluster notification is set, all users will notificated, and usersl
will not be able to disable notification for themselves.  This isM
because VMS is unable to find out user names logged in at other nodes,
which requires BULLETIN to keep a list of users to notify.  If /DEFAULT 
is specified, the list may be very large, which would cause theO
notification process to take a very long time.  It is much easier to
simply notify all users.  However, /NOCLUSTER will override this, 
causing the list to be generated.l
3 /CLUSTER  
 /[NO]CLUSTERo

Specifies that if /ALL or /DEFAULT has been selected, and clustert
notification is enabled, all users across the network will be notified
of new messages.  Users will not be able to disable notification.r
This is the default.  /NOCLUSTER will disable this causing /DEFAULTr
and /ALL to work as it normally does, i.e. /DEFAULT simply setting
the default for new users, and /ALL causing all users to be notified
while enabling users to disable notification.  However, if your system
has a lot of users, this will cause the notification algorithm to take
a very long time.p
3 /FOLDER 
   /FOLDER=foldernamep

Specifies the folder for which the option is to modified.  If notl
specified, the selected folder is modified. Valid only with NONOTIFY.]
2 PAGE
Specifies whether any directory listing or message reading output will
pause when it reaches the end of the page or not.  Setting NOPAGE is F
useful for terminals that can store more than one screenful at a time,
and that have a remote printer that can then print the contents of the
terminal's memory.  The default is PAGE, unless the default was changed 
by specifying /NOPAGE on the command line to invoke BULLETIN.d

  Format:t

    SET [NO]PAGE
2 PRIVILEGES
Specifies either process privileges or rights identifiers that are
necessary to use privileged commands.  Use the SHOW PRIVILEGES command
to see what is presently set.  This is a privileged command.

  Format:.

    SET PRIVILEGES parameters 

The parameters are one or more privileges separated by commas. l
To remove a privilege, specify the privilege preceeded by "NO".d
If /ID is specified, the parameters are rights identifiers.d
3 /IDd
 /[NO]ID

If specified, then the rights identifier which is specified as the
parameter will allow users holding that rights identifier to execute
privileged commands.  If /NOID is specified, the identifier is removed.t
2 PROMPT_EXPIREw
Specifies that a user will be prompted for an expiration date when adding 
a message.  If NOPROMPT_EXPIRE is specified, the user will not be prompted,v
and the default expiration (which is set by SET DEFAULT_EXPIRE or SETr
BBOARD/EXPIRATION) will be used.  If the value specified is greater than the
expiration limit, and the user does not have privileges, then the expiration
limit will be used as the default expiration.  (If there is no expiration.
limit, and the user doesn't have privileges, then an error will result.)
PROMPT_EXPIRE is the default.t

  Format:i

    SET [NO]PROMPT_EXPIRE 
2 READNEW
Controls whether you will be prompted upon logging in if you wish to read 
new non-system or folder messages (if any exist).  The default is dependenta
on how the folder was created by the owner.a

In order to apply this to a specific folder, first select the folder i
(using the SELECT command), and then enter the SET READNEW command./
For messages in folders other than the GENERAL folder, both prompting 
and display of topics of new messages are controlled by this command.l
For the GENERAL folder, the display of topics cannot be disabled.i

  Format:d

    SET [NO]READNEWp

NOTE: If you have several folders with READNEW enabled, each folder'sM
messages will be displayed separately.  However, if you EXIT the READNEW
mode before all the folders have been displayed, you will not be alerted
of the new messages in the undisplayed folders the next time you login. 
However, if you enter BULLETIN, you will be told that new messages are
present in those other folders.  Also, it is not possible to EXIT thee
READNEW mode if there are SYSTEM folders which have new messages. Typing
the EXIT command will cause you to skip to those folders.  (See HELP
SET SYSTEM for a description of a SYSTEM folder). 
3 /ALL
Specifies that the SET [NO]READNEW option is the default for all users for
the specified folder.  This is a privileged qualifier.  The difference
between this and /DEFAULT is that the latter will only apply to new usersp
(i.e. any users which have never executed BULLETIN).
3 /DEFAULT
Specifies that the [NO]READNEW option is the default for the specified
folder.  This is a privileged qualifier.  It will only affect brand new
users (or those that have never logged in).  Use /ALL to modify all users.
3 /FOLDERt
   /FOLDER=foldernamec

Specifies the folder for which the option is to modified.  If not 
specified, the selected folder is modified. Valid only with NOREADNEW.
2 SHOWNEW 
Controls whether a directory listing of new messages for the current
folder will be displayed when logging in.  This is similar to READNEW,
except you will not be prompted to read the messages.  The default isc
dependent on how the folder was created by the owner.t

In order to apply this to a specific folder, first select the folder g
(using the SELECT command), and then enter the SET SHOWNEW command.c
This command cannot be used for the GENERAL folder. 

  Format:a

    SET [NO]SHOWNEW 
3 /ALL
Specifies that the SET [NO]SHOWNEW option is the default for all users for
the specified folder.  This is a privileged qualifier.  The difference
between this and /DEFAULT is that the latter will only apply to new users 
(i.e. any users which have never executed BULLETIN).
3 /DEFAULT
Specifies that the [NO]SHOWNEW option is the default for the specified
folder.  This is a privileged qualifier.  It will only affect brand newl
users (or those that have never logged in).  Use /ALL to modify all users.
3 /FOLDERu
   /FOLDER=foldernamet

Specifies the folder for which the option is to modified.  If not 
specified, the selected folder is modified. Valid only with NOSHOWNEW.
2 STRIPr
Affect only messages which are added via either the BBOARD option, oro
written directly from a network mailing program (i.e. PMDF).  If
STRIP is set, the header of the mail message will be stripped offs
before it is stored as a BULLETIN message.

  Format: 

    SET [NO]STRIPi

The command SHOW FOLDER/FULL will show if STRIP has been set. 
2 SYSTEM
Specifies that the selected folder is a SYSTEM folder.  A SYSTEM folder
is allowed to have SYSTEM and SHUTDOWN messages added to it.  This is an
privileged command.e

  Format:s

    SET [NO]SYSTEM

By default, the GENERAL folder is a SYSTEM folder, and the setting for
that folder cannot be removed.

If the selected folder is remote, /SYSTEM cannot be specified unless the
folder at the other node is also a SYSTEM folder.l
1 SHOW
The SHOW command displays information about certain characteristics.
2 FLAGSn
Shows whether BRIEF, NOTIFY, READNEW, or SHOWNEW has been set for thei
currently selected folder.
2 FOLDER
Shows information about a folder of messages.  Owner and description are
shown.  If the folder name is omitted, and a folder has been selected viai
the SELECT command, information about that folder is shown.i

  Format:e

    SHOW FOLDER [folder-name]e
3 /FULL 
Control whether all information of the folder is displayed.  This 
includes DUMP & SYSTEM settings, the access list if the folder ist
private, and BBOARD information.  This information is only those who
have access to that folder. 
2 KEYPAD
Displays the keypad command definitions.  If the keypad has been enabled
by either the SET KEYPAD COMMAND, or /KEYPAD is specified on the command l
line, the keypad keys will be defined as commands.  SHOW KEYPAD is the
equivalent of HELP KEYPAD.

NOTE: If the keypad is not enabled, PF2 is defined to be SET KEYPAD.
3 /PRINT
Prints the keypad definitions on the default printer (SYS$PRINT). 
2 NEW
Shows folders which have new unread messages for which BRIEF or READNEW
have been set.  (Note: If you enter BULLETIN but do not read new unreads
messages, you will not be notified about them the next time you enter 
BULLETIN.  This is a design "feature" and cannot easily be changed.)
2 PRIVILEGES
Shows the privileges necessary to use privileged commands.  Also shows
any rights identifiers that would also give a user privileges.  (The
latter are ACLs which are set on the BULLUSER.DAT file.)
2 USER
Shows the last time that a user logged in.  If NOLOGIN is set for a user,D
this information will be displayed instead.  This is a privileged command.
Non-privileged users will only be able to display the information for 
their own account.

  Format:h
    SHOW USER [username]

The username is optional.  If omitted, the process's username is used.
The username should not be included if /ALL or /[NO]LOGIN is specified.  s

NOTE: The last logged in time displayed is that which is stored when the
BULLETIN/LOGIN command is executed, not that which VMS stores.  Some sites
make BULLETIN/LOGIN an optional command for users to store in their ownm
LOGIN.COM, so this command can be used to show which users have done this.
3 /ALL
Specifies that information for all users is to be displayed.  This is ac
privileged command.e
3 /LOGIN
 /[NO]LOGINe

Specifies that only those users which do not have NOLOGIN set are to bet
displayed.  If negated, only those users with NOLOGIN set are displayed.
This is a privileged command.  The qualifier /ALL need not be specified.
2 VERSIONe
Shows the version of BULLETIN and the date that the executable was linked.
1 SPAWNy
Creates a subprocess of the current process.  To return to BULLETIN,
type LOGOUT.

  Format:G
    SPAWN [command-string]

NOTE: BULLETIN disables the use of CONTROL-C, so that you must use  
CONTROL-Y if you wish to break out of a spawned command.
1 UNDELETE
Undeletes the specified message if the message was deleted using the
DELETE command.  Deleted messages are not actually deleted but have theira
expiration date set to 15 minutes in the future and are deleted then.
Undeleting the message will reset the expiration date back to its original
value.  Deleted messages will be indicated as such by the string (DELETED)
when either reading or doing a directory listing.f

  Format:e
    UNDELETE [message-number]D
