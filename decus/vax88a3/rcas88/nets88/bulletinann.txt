Subject: BULLETIN
 
You  are  about  to  receive  version  1.51  of the PFC BULLETIN.
 
BULLETIN   is   public   domain   software.    (I   will  gladly  accept
recommendations for new features,  not  for  changes  that  are  due  to
"personal" preference.)
 
The previous announcement of a feature that could allow one to eliminate
BBOARD accounts unfortunately does not work with mail received via PMDF,
and probably other packages.  See HELP SET BBOARD MORE_INFORMATION.  If
your site uses a mailing method that will allow the feature to be used,
you should be aware that there has been a minor change in BOARD_DIGEST.COM
which is related to that feature, so that file should be updated.
 
NOTE: If you are upgrading from a version older than 1.4, you should  be
aware that the logical names BULLETIN$ and BULL$HELP are no longer being
used in the sources.  Also, BULLFOLDER.DAT is converted to a new  format
when  it  is run.  This will cause problems in a cluster where each node
must have the executable reinstalled.  It is best to deinstall  the  old
executable on all nodes before installing the new executable.
 
(The latest feature and bug fixes for this new version are listed later.)
 
You will be receiving 13 files (NOT NECESSARILY IN THIS ORDER!):
	1) BULLETIN.FOR
	2) BULLETIN0.FOR
	3) BULLETIN1.FOR
	4) BULLETIN2.FOR
	5) BULLETIN3.FOR
	6) BULLETIN4.FOR
	7) BULLETIN5.FOR
	8) BULLETIN6.FOR
	9) BULLETIN7.FOR
	10) BULLETIN8.FOR
	11) ALLMACS.MAR
	12) BULLCOMS1.HLP
	13) BULLCOMS2.HLP
	14) BULLET1.COM
	15) BULLET2.COM
 
(They will be  identified  in  the  SUBJECT  header.)   BULLET1.COM  and
BULLET2.COM  are  command procedures which when run, will create several
small files.  After you run it, you can delete it.   Read  AAAREADME.TXT
for installation instructions.
 
NOTE: When creating these files (using the EXTRACT command) from the VMS
MAIL utility, you will have to strip  off  any  mail  headers  that  are
present, including blank lines.  A command procedure is included at this
end of this message which can be run which uses EDT to do this for  you.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The  following  is  a  description of recent new features and bug fixes.
V1.46 was a minor upgrade which was not distributed to all.  V1.5  is  a
major upgrade with many new features.
 
V1.46
 
The times of the last message read for each folder is now  stored  in  a
global     file     BULLINF.DAT     rather    than    individually    in
SYS$LOGIN:BULLETIN.INF.  This was due to conflicts  with  accounts  that
shared the same directory.
 
Made several modifications to optimize program  running  time.   Changed
all formatted disk reads to unformatted reads.  Changed search algorithm
for latest message in a folder from sequential to binary.  Made  changes
to speed up BULLCP.
 
V1.5
 
Sharing of folders over DECNET is now possible via  the  BULLCP  process
created  by  BULLETIN/STARTUP.   It  is  now  possible  to SELECT, READ,
DELETE, etc. a folder on another node.  It is also possible to create  a
folder that "points" to a folder on another node (i.e. by selecting FOO,
it automatically selects VAX1::FOO).
 
Any  folder  can  be  made  a SYSTEM folder, i.e. a folder than can have
SYSTEM/SHUTDOWN/BROADCAST  messages  added  to  it.   This  allows   the
possibility  of  having a local SYSTEM folder and a shared GLOBAL SYSTEM
folder.  One can also use this to easily display SYSTEM  messages  meant
for  only  certain  UIC groups.  This could be done by creating a SYSTEM
PRIVATE folder, with access limited to one UIC group.
 
CTRL-C will now abort BULLETIN if BULLETIN is not waiting for input from
the  terminal.   This  is  to  allow  breaking  out  of  a  slow or hung
operations (particularly possible with  remote  folders).   CTRL-Y  will
continue to work as normal, i.e. to break out but be able to continue if
desired.
 
The /SYSTEM qualifier on the BULLETIN  command  can  now  be  used  with
/LOGIN  to  cause  system  messages  to  be  continually displayed for a
certain time period rather than just once.
 
New qualifiers in commands:
	READ/EDIT & CURRENT/EDIT - Uses editor to read message.
	RESPOND/EDIT/TEXT - Uses editor to create reply message, and
		allows text of message to be read in.
 
The DELETE command can now delete a range of messages,  i.e. DELETE n-m.
 
The /FOLDER qualifier on the ADD command will now accept more than one
folder name.  Folders on other nodes can be specified as long as BULLCP
is running on that other node, i.e. /FOLDER=PFCVAX::GENERAL.  Prompting
for password for privileged is not necessary, unlike /NODE, since proxy
logins are used.  It is also much faster than /NODE.
 
Entering BULLETIN should be faster due to optimization (removed code which
unnecessarily was opening folder files).
 
Non-ascii characters are removed in messages.  This avoids funny escape
sequences which a user might have in a text file.
 
V1.51
 
INDEX command added (from Brian@uoft02.bitnet).  Gives directory listing
of all folders in sequence.  Messages can be read during the listing, and
then the listing can be continued.  /NEW will cause the listing of each
folder to start with the first unread message.
 
Includes MAKEFILE for MAKE command for assembling executable.
 
Modify SEARCH command to search description of message also (MAIL does this.)
 
Includes many bug fixes and optimization changes.
