Subject: BULLETIN

Apparently, there is another small bug in BULLETIN7.FOR which has been there
for a while which didn't cause any problems until I modified the cleanup
algorithm. There are 2 lines in the subroutine NEW_MESSAGE_NOTIFICATION which
contain the string "0,FOLDER_MAX"  which should be changed to "0,FOLDER_MAX-1".
This bug apparently will cause the SET NOTIFY flag to disappear for the
GENERAL folder. 							MRL
