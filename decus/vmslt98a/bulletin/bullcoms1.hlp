1 ADD
Adds a message to the specified folder.  A file can be  specified  which
contains  the  message.    Otherwise, BULLETIN will prompt for the text.
BULLETIN will ask for an expiration date and a  header  to  contain  the
topic of the message. 

  Format:
    ADD [file-name]
2 /ALL
This option is restricted to privileged users.  It is used in conjunction
with the /BROADCAST qualifier.  If specified, all terminals are sent the
message.  Otherwise, only users are sent the message.
2 /BELL
This option is restricted to privileged users.  It is used in conjunction 
with the /BROADCAST qualifier.  If specified, the bell is rung on the 
terminals when the message is broadcasted.
2 /BROADCAST
This option is restricted to privileged users and SYSTEM  folders.    If
specified,  a message is both stored and broadcasted to all users logged
in at the time.  If the folder is remote, a message will be broadcast on
all  nodes  which  are  connected  to  that  folder,  unless  /LOCAL  is
specified.  A node which does not have  BULLCP  running  cannot  have  a
message  broadcasted  to  it, (even though it is able to create a remote
folder).   A broadcasted message is limited to 1600 characters

See also /ALL and /BELL.
2 /CLUSTER
 /[NO]CLUSTER

This option specifies that broadcasted messages should be sent to all
nodes in the cluster.  /CLUSTER is the default.
2 /EDIT
 /[NO]EDIT
Determines whether or not the editor is invoked to edit the message
you are adding.  /EDIT is the default if you have added /EDIT to your
BULLETIN command line.
2 /EXPIRATION
 /EXPIRATION=time

Specifies the time at which the message is to expire.  Either absolute
time: [dd-mmm-yyyy] hh:mm:ss, or delta time: dddd [hh:mm:ss] can be
used.
2 /EXTRACT
Specifies that the text of the previously read message should be included
at the beginning of the new message.  The previous message must be in the
same folder.  This qualifier is valid only when used with /EDIT.  The
text is indented with -> at the beginning of each line.  This can be
suppressed or the indentation character changed with /[NO]INDENT.
2 /FOLDER
 /FOLDER=(foldername,[...])

Specifies the foldername into which the message is to be  added.    Does
not  change the current selected folder.  Folders can be either local or
remote folders.  Thus, a  nodename  can  precede  the  foldername  (this
assumes that the remote node is capable of supporting this feature, i.e.
the BULLCP process is running on that node.  If  it  is  not,  you  will
receive an error message).  If the the foldername is specified with only
a nodename, i.e. FOO::, the foldername is  assumed  to  be  the  default
folder.    NOTE: Specifying remote nodes is only possible if that remote
node is running a special BULLCP process.  If it isn't, the only way  to
add  messages  to  that  remote node is via the /NODE command.  /FOLDER,
however, is a much quicker method, and much more versatile. 

You can specify logical names which translate  to  one  or  more  folder
names.   I.e.   $  DEFINE ALL_FOLDERS "VAX1,VAX2,VAX3", and then specify
ALL_FOLDERS after /FOLDER=.  Note that the quotation marks are required.

When using /FOLDER for remote nodes, proxy logins are used to  determine
if privileged options are allowed.  If they are not allowed, the message
will still be added, but without the privileged settings.
2 /LOCAL
Specifies  that  when  /BROADCAST  is specified for a remote folder, the
message is broadcasted ONLY on the local node.
2 /NODES
 /NODES=(nodes[,...])

Specifies  to send the message to the listed DECNET nodes.  The BULLETIN
utility  must  be  installed  properly  on  the   other   nodes.    (See
installation  notes). You can specify a different username to use at the
other nodes by either using the USERNAME qualifier, or by specifying the
nodename   with   2   semi-colons   followed   by   the  username,  i.e.
nodename::username.  If you specify a username, you will be prompted for
the password of the account on the other nodes.

Additionally,  you  can  specify logical names which translate to one or
more node names.  I.e.  $ DEFINE ALL_NODES  "VAX1,VAX2,VAX3",  and  then
specify /NODES=ALL_NODES.  Note that the quotation marks are required.

NOTE:  It  is  preferable  to  use /FOLDER instead of /NODE if possible,
since adding messages via /FOLDER is much quicker.
2 /INDENT
 /[NO]INDENT=string

See /EXTRACT for information on this qualifier.
2 /NOSIGNATURE
Specifies to suppress the automatically appended signature, if one exists.
Signatures are appended for postings to mailing lists and to responds.
See the help topic POST Signature_file for signature information.
2 /PERMANENT
If specified, message will be a permanent message and will never expire.
If an expiration limit is set, then permament is not allowed unless
user has privileges.
2 /SUBJECT
 /SUBJECT=description

Specifies the subject of the message to be added.
2 /SHUTDOWN
 /SHUTDOWN[=nodename]
This option is restricted to privileged users.   If  specified,  message
will  be  automatically  deleted after a computer shutdown has occurred.
This option is restricted to SYSTEM folders. 

If the bulletin files are shared between cluster nodes, the message will
be  deleted  after  the  node on which the message was submitted from is
rebooted.  If you wish the message to be deleted after a different  node
reboots,  you have the option of specifying that node name.  The message
deletion is keyed by BULLETIN running on the  node  that  reboots.    It
writes  into  the  database  info  that  the node has rebooted, and when
BULLCP wakes up and sees this info, it will delete any shutdown messages
for that node. 

NOTE: If the folder is a remote folder,  the  message  will  be  deleted
after  the  remote node reboots, not the node from which the message was
added.  The nodename cannot be specified with a remote folder. 
2 /SYSTEM
This option is restricted to privileged users.  If specified, message
is both saved in the folder and displayed in full as a system message
when a user logs in.  System messages should be as brief as possible to
avoid the possibility that system messages could scroll off the screen.
This option is restricted to SYSTEM folders.
2 /USERNAME
Specifies username to be used at remote DECNET nodes when adding messages
to DECNET nodes via the /NODE qualifier.
1 ATTACH
Permits you to switch control of your terminal from your current process
to another process in your job. 

The ATTACH command allows you to move quickly between processes that you
have created with the SPAWN command.  For example, while you are editing
a file, you can SPAWN a subprocess to read a new  message.    Enter  the
ATTACH  command to get back to back to the editing session.  If you want
to read another new message, you can use the ATTACH command to get  back
to the BULLETN subprocess you already created. 

   Format:

       ATTACH [/PARENT] [process-name]
2 Parameters

 process-name

  Indicates the name of the subprocess to which the connection  is  to
  be made. Only the /PARENT qualifier or a process-name may be specified.

2 Qualifiers

/PARENT

   Allows you to attach to your process' parent process.
   If there is no parent process an error message is printed.


2 Examples

  1.   
       $ SPAWN BULLETIN
       %DCL-S-SPAWNED, process MAGNANI_3 spawned
       %DCL-S-ATTACHED, terminal now attached to process MAGNANI_3
       BULLETIN> ATTACH MAGNANI_2
       %DCL-S-RETURNED, control returned to process MAGNANI_2
       $ ATTACH MAGNANI_3
       BULLETIN>


  This  example  shows  how  to  spawn  subprocesses  (MAGNANI_2   and
  MAGNANI_3) to move from BULLETIN to DCL back to BULLETIN.  The ATTACH 
  command  allows you to transfer control between subprocesses.


                                  NOTE

      You always SPAWN a new process and ATTACH to a process  that
      already exists.
1 BACK
Displays the message preceding the current message.
2 /EDIT
Specifies that the editor is to be used to read the message.  This is
useful for scanning a long message.
2 /HEADER
 /[NO]HEADER

Specifies that if a message header exists, the header will be shown.
If /HEADER or /NOHEADER is specified, the setting will apply for all
further reads in the selected folder.  The default is /HEADER for non-
NEWS folders, /NOHEADER for NEWS folders.  If the SET STRIP command
is set for the folder, it will change the default to be /HEADER.
A user can make this option the default for a particular folder or
news group.  See HELP Customizing.
1 BULLETIN
The BULLETIN utility permits a user to create a message for  reading  by
all  users.    Users are notified upon logging in that new messages have
been added, and what the topic of the messages are.  Actual  reading  of
the  messages  is  optional.  (See  the  command SET READNEW for info on
automatic  reading.)  Messages  are  automatically  deleted  when  their
expiration date has passed. 
1 CHANGE
Replaces or modifies existing stored message.  This is for changing part
or  all  of  a  message  without causing users who have already seen the
message to be notified of it a second time.  You can  select  qualifiers
so  that  either the message text, expiration date, or the header are to
be changed.  If no qualifier is added, the default  is  that  all  these
parameters  are  to  be  changed.    If the text of the message is to be
changed, a file can be specified which contains the text.  If the editor
is  used  for changing the text, the old message text will be extracted.
This can be suppressed by the qualifier /NEW. 

  Format:
    CHANGE [file-name]
2 /ALL
Makes the changes to all the messages in the folder.  Only the expiration
date and message headers can be changed if this qualifier is specified.
2 /EDIT
 /[NO]EDIT
Determines whether or not the editor is invoked to edit the message
you are replacing.  The old message text is read into the editor unless
a file-name or /NEW is specified.  /EDIT is the default if you have
added /EDIT to your BULLETIN command line.
2 /EXPIRATION
 /EXPIRATION[=time]

Specifies the time at which the message is to expire.  Either absolute
time: [dd-mmm-yyyy] hh:mm:ss, or delta time: dddd [hh:mm:ss] can be
used.  If no time is specified, you will be prompted for the time.
2 /GENERAL
Specifies that the message is to be converted from a SYSTEM message to
a GENERAL message.
2 /HEADER
Specifies that the message header is to be replaced.  You will be
prompted for the new message description.
2 /OWNER
 /OWNER=string

Specifies a new owner name.  Can only be changed if you own the folder
or have privileges.
2 /NEW
If the editor is to be used for replacing the text of the message,
NEW specifies not to read in the old message text, and that a totally
new text is to be read in.
2 /NUMBER
 /NUMBER=message_number[-message_number1]

Specifies the message or messages to be replaced. If this  qualifier  is
omitted,  the  message that is presently being read will be replaced.  A
range of  messages  can  be  specified,  i.e.  /NUMBER=1-5.    Only  the
expiration  date  and  message  headers  can  be  changed  if a range is
specified. 

The key words CURRENT and LAST can also be specified in  the  range,  in
place of an actual number, i.e. CURRENT-LAST, 1-CURRENT, etc. 
2 /PERMANENT
Specifies that the message is to be made permanent.
2 /SHUTDOWN
 /SHUTDOWN[=nodename]
Specifies that the message is to expire after the next computer
shutdown.  This option is restricted to SYSTEM folders.
2 /SUBJECT
 /SUBJECT=description

Specifies the subject of the message to be added.
2 /SYSTEM
Specifies that the message is to be made a SYSTEM message.  This is a
privileged command and is restricted to SYSTEM folders.
2 /TEXT
Specifies that the message text is to be replaced.
1 COPY
Copies a message to another folder  without  deleting  it  from  the
current folder.

  Format:

    COPY folder-name [message_number][-message_number1]

The folder-name is the name of the folder to which the message is to be
copied to.  Optionally, a range of messages which are to be copied can be
specified following the folder name, i.e. COPY NEWFOLDER 2-5.

The key words CURRENT and LAST can also be specified in the range,
in place of an actual number, i.e. CURRENT-LAST, 1-CURRENT, etc.
2 /ALL
Specifies to copy all the messages in the old folder.
2 /GROUPS
 /GROUPS=(newsgroup,[...])

Valid only if a NEWS group is selected.  Specifies to send the message to
the specified NEWS group(s) in addition to the selected NEWS group.
2 /HEADER
 /[NO]HEADER

Valid only if destination folder is a news group.  Specifies that header
of message is to be included with the text when the text is copied.
The default is /NOHEADER.
2 /LOCAL
If specified and destination is a folder, the message will only be copied 
to the folder, and will not be emailed to a corresponding email address or
sent to a an associated news group, if either is present for the folder.
If the destination is a news group, message header has line added to it
to avoid having the message from being copied to a folder which has that
news group feeding to it.
2 /MERGE
Specifies that the original date and time of the copied messages are
saved and that the messages are placed in correct chronological order 
in the new folder.  This operation is lengthy if the new folder is large.
2 /ORIGINAL
Specifies that the owner of the copied message will be the original owner
of the message.  The default is that the copied message will be owned by
the person copying the message.
1 CREATE
Creates a folder of messages.  This is similar to the folders in the VMS
MAIL utility.  Folders are often created so that messages of  a  similar
topic are grouped separately, or to restrict reading of certain messages
to  specified  users.   Once  created,  that  message  is  automatically
selected  (see information on SELECT command).  The commands that can be
used to modify the folder's characteristics  are:  MODIFY,  REMOVE,  SET
ACCESS, SET BBOARD, SET NODE, and SET SYSTEM.

  Format:
    CREATE folder-name

The  folder-name is limited to 25 letters and must not include spaces or
characters that are also invalid  in  filenames  (this  is  because  the
folder is stored in a file name created with the folder name).

NOTE:  Creation  of folders may be a restricted command if the installer
has  elected  to  install  it  as  such.   This  is  done  by  modifying
BULLCOM.CLD.
2 /ALWAYS
Specifies that  the  folder  has  the  ALWAYS  attribute.   This  causes
messages  in  the  folder  to  be displayed differently when logging in.
SYSTEM messages will be displayed every time a user logs in, rather than
just  once.   Non-SYSTEM  message  will also be displayed every time (in
whatever mode is selected, i.e. BRIEF, SHOWNEW, or  READNEW)  until  the
user  actually  reads  that  message  (or a later one).  This feature is
meant for messages which are very important, and thus you want  to  make
sure they are read.
2 /ADD_ONLY
Specifies that the folder has the ADD_ONLY  attribute.    If  a  mailing
address  is  present  (see /DESCRIPTION), when messages are added to the
folder, they will also be mailed to the address.   Users  are  prevented
from  using  the POST command.  Instead, the ADD command will be used if
the POST command is entered.  One use for this is a local board which is
also distributed to non-local users. 
2 /BRIEF
Specifies that all users automatically have BRIEF set for  this  folder.
Only  a privileged user can use this qualifier.  (See HELP SET BRIEF for
more information.)
2 /DESCRIPTION
 /DESCRIPTION=description

Specifies the description of the folder, which is  displayed  using  the
SHOW FOLDER command.  If omitted, you are prompted for a description. 

If this folder is to receive messages from a network  mailing  list  via
the  BBOARD  feature,  and  you  wish  to  use the POST and RESPOND/LIST
commands, the address of the mailing list  should  be  included  in  the
description.  This is done by enclosing the address using <> and placing
it at the end of the description, i.e. 

              INFOVAX MAILING LIST <INFO-VAX@KL.SRI.COM>

You can also use this feature to have messages  which  are  added  to  a
folder  to  be  mailed to the email address.  This is common if you have
users that don't have access to BULLETIN.  Note:  When  you  specify  an
email address, the folder automatically will have the ADD_ONLY flag set,
which causes both ADD and POST to both add a message and send  mail  the
message.  Note that a message added to the folder via the BBOARD feature
will also be mailed to the specified email address.  In this way,  users
without  access  to  BULLETIN  can  add  messages by sending mail to the
BBOARD account.  If you create a remote  folder  pointing  to  a  folder
associated  with an email address, you must specify the email address in
the description of the remote folder also.  Please also read  about  the
SET GATEWAY command. 

It is also possible to use the description to specify a news group from
which messages are fed into the folder.  See the file FOLDER_TO_NEWS.TXT
for more info.
2 /ID
Designates that the name  specified  as  the  owner  name  is  a  rights
identifier.    The  creator's process must have the identifier presently
assigned to it.  Any process which has that identifier  assigned  to  it
will  be  able  to  control the folder as if it were the folder's owner.
This is used to allow more than one  use  to  control  a  folder.    The
identifier can not be any longer than 12 characters. 

Note: This feature will not work during remote access to the folder.
2 /NODE
 /NODE=node

Specifies that the folder is a remote folder at the specified node.    A
remote folder is a folder in which the messages are actually stored on a
folder at a remote DECNET node.  The specified node is checked to see if
a  folder  of  the same name is located on that node.  If so, the folder
will then be modified to point to that folder.  For example if there was
a folder on node A with name INFO, and you issued the command: 
                        CREATE INFO/NODE=A
from node B, then if INFO is selected  on  node  B,  you  will  actually
obtain  the  folder  INFO  on  node  A.  In this manner, a folder can be
shared between more than one node. This capability is  only  present  if
the  BULLCP  process  is running on the remote node via the BULL/STARTUP
command.  If the remote folder name is different from the  local  folder
name,  the  remote  folder  name  is  specified  using  the  /REMOTENAME
qualifier. 

NOTE: If a message is added to a remote  node,  the  message  is  stored
immediately.    However,  a  user logging into another node might not be
immediately alerted that the message is present.   That  information  is
only  updated  every  15  minutes  (same  algorithm  for updating BBOARD
messages), or if a user accesses that folder.  Thus, if  the  folder  is
located on node A, and the message is added from node B, and a user logs
in to node C, the BULLETIN login notification might not notify the  user
of  the  message.  However, if the message is added with /BROADCAST, the
message will be broadcasted immediately to all nodes. 
2 /NOTIFY
Specifies that all users automatically have NOTIFY set for this  folder.
Only a privileged user can use this qualifier.  (See HELP SET NOTIFY for
more information.)
2 /OWNER
 /OWNER=username
Specifies the owner of the folder.  This is a privileged command.
See also /ID.
2 /POST_ONLY
Specifies that the folder has the POST_ONLY attribute.  This causes 
the ADD command to mail the message to the mailing address if it is 
present (see /DESCRIPTION), rather than add to the folder.  
2 /PRIVATE
Specifies that the folder can only be accessed by users  who  have  been
granted  access via the SET ACCESS command.  Note: This option uses ACLs
and users who are granted access must be entered into  the  Rights  Data
Base.   If the RDB does not exist on your system, a privileged user will
have to create it.  If a user is not  in  the  RDB,  this  program  will
automatically  enter  the user into it (unless this feature was disabled
during the compilation of this program).  NOTE: See HELP SET ACCESS  for
more info. 

WARNING:  This command can not be used with remote nodes.    Create  the
folder  without  it and then use SET ACCESS to change protection.  Also,
access protection on the remote node will override local protection. 
2 /READNEW
Specifies that all users automatically have READNEW set for this folder.
Only  a  privileged  user can use this qualifier.  (See HELP SET READNEW
for more information.)
2 /REMOTENAME
 /REMOTENAME=foldername
Valid only if /NODE is present, i.e. that the folder is a remote folder.
Specifies the name of the remote folder name.  If not specified, it is
assumed that the remote name is the same as the local name.
2 /SHOWNEW
Specifies that all users automatically have SHOWNEW set for this folder.
Only a privileged user can use this qualifier.  (See HELP SET SHOWNEW for
more information.)
2 /SEMIPRIVATE
Similar to /PRIVATE, except that the folder is restricted only with
respect to adding or modifying messages.  All users can read the folder.

WARNING:  This command can not be used with remote nodes.  Create the 
folder without it and then use SET ACCESS to change protection.  Also,
access protection on the remote node will override local protection.
2 /SYSTEM
Specifies that the folder is a SYSTEM folder.  A SYSTEM folder is
allowed to have SYSTEM and SHUTDOWN messages added to it.  This is a
privileged command.
                                                         
If this is a remote folder, /SYSTEM cannot be specified unless the
folder at the other node is also a SYSTEM folder.
1 Ctrl-C
Except for when BULLETIN is awaiting input from the terminal, a 
CTRL-C will cause BULLETIN to abort the execution of any command.  If
BULLETIN is waiting for terminal input, a CTRL-C will cause BULLETIN
to return to the BULLETIN> prompt.  If for some reason the user wishes
to suspend BULLETIN, CTRL-Y will usually do so.  However, this is not
always true, as BULLETIN will ignore the CTRL-Y if it has a data file
opened at the time. (Otherwise it would be possible to put the files
in a state such that they would be inaccessible by other users.)
1 CURRENT
Displays the beginning of the message you are currently reading.  If
you  are  reading  a long message and want to display the first part
of the message again, you can enter the CURRENT command.

  Format:

    CURRENT
2 /EDIT
Specifies that the editor is to be used to read the message.  This is
useful for scanning a long message.
2 /HEADER
 /[NO]HEADER

Specifies that if a message header exists, the header will be shown.  If
either /HEADER or /NOHEADER is specified, the setting will apply for all
further reads in the selected folder.  The default is /HEADER  for  non-
NEWS  folders,  /NOHEADER for NEWS folders.  If the SET STRIP command is
set for the folder, it will change the default to be /HEADER.    A  user
can  make this option the default for a particular folder or news group.
See HELP Customizing. 
2 /ROTATE
Specifies to decode the message using ROT-13 coding.
1 DELETE
Deletes the specified message.  If no message is specified, the  current
message  is  deleted.   Only the original owner or a privileged user can
delete a message.  Note that the message is not deleted immediately, but
its expiration is set 15 minutes in the future.  This is to allow a user
to recover the message using the UNDELETE command.    If  you  want  the
message deleted immediately, use the /IMMEDIATE qualifier. 

  Format:
    DELETE [message_number][-message_number1]

The message's relative number is found by the DIRECTORY command.  It  is
possible  to  delete  a  range  of  messages  by  specifying two numbers
separated by a dash, i.e. DELETE  1-5.    However,  a  range  cannot  be
specified if the folder is remote. 

The key words CURRENT and LAST can also be specified in  the  range,  in
place of an actual number, i.e. CURRENT-LAST, 1-CURRENT, etc. 
2 /ALL
Specifies to delete all the messages in the folder.  Note:  This will
not work for remote folders.  Only one message can be deleted from a
remote folder at a time.
2 /IMMEDIATE
Specifies that the message is to be deleted immediately.  Not applicable
to news groups that are stored on disk.
2 /LOCAL
Only used with news groups stored on disk.  Only the local message will
be deleted.  No delete message will be sent to the Usenet network to
delete the message at other nodes.
2 /NODES
 /NODES=(nodes[,...])

Specifies to delete the  message  at  the  listed  DECNET  nodes.    The
BULLETIN utility must be installed properly on the other nodes.  You can
specify a different username to use at the other nodes by  either  using
the USERNAME qualifier, or by specifying the nodename with 2 semi-colons
followed by the username, i.e. nodename::username.   If  you  specify  a
username,  you  will  be prompted for the password of the account on the
other nodes.  The /SUBJECT must be specified to  identify  the  specific
message that is to be deleted. 

Additionally, you can specify logical names which translate  to  one  or
more  node  names.   I.e.  $ DEFINE ALL_NODES "VAX1,VAX2,VAX3", and then
specify /NODES=ALL_NODES.  Note that the quotation marks are required. 
2 /SUBJECT
 /SUBJECT=subject

Specifies the subject of the bulletin to be deleted at a  remote  DECNET
node.   The DECNET node must be specified with the /NODE qualifier.  The
specified subject need not be the exact subject of the message.  It  can
be  a  substring of the subject.  This is in case you have forgotten the
exact subject that was specified.  Case is not  critical  either.    You
will be notified if the deletion was successful.  See also /NEGATED. 
2 /USERNAME
Specifies username to be used  at  remote  DECNET  nodes  when  deleting
messages on other DECNET nodes via the /NODE qualifier. 
1 DIRECTORY
Lists a summary of the messages.  The message number, submitter's  name,
date, and subject of each message is displayed. 

  Format:

    DIRECTORY [folder]

If  a  folder is specified, that folder is selected before the directory
is listed.  Unless otherwise specified, listing starts  with  the  first
newest message.  If there are no new messages, listing will start at the
first message, or if a message has already been read, it will  start  at
that message.
2 /ALL
Lists all messages.  Used if the qualifiers /MARKED, /UNMARKED, /SEEN,
or /UNSEEN were previously specified. 
2 /CONTINUE
Used with /GROUP.  Allows you to continue a search after you have broken
the  search by entering a command, i.e. READ, SEARCH, etc.  Note: If you
enter a SEARCH command which specifies a string, and then  continue  the
directory  search using /CONTINUE, the new search pattern will be used
when continuing the search. 
2 /DESCRIBE 
Valid when used with /FOLDERS.  Specifies to include description of
folder. 
2 /EXPIRATION
Shows the message's expiration date rather than the creation date.
2 /END

Indicates the last message number you want to display.
2 /EXTRACT
 /EXTRACT=filename

Specifies that the text of the messages which are found by the DIRECTORY
command are to be written into the specified file.  All qualifiers which
are valid for the EXTRACT command are valid in conjunction with /EXTRACT
except  for /NEW which conflicts with the DIRECTORY /NEW qualifier.  The
listof messages to be printed will be  displayed  on  the  terminal  (in
nopaging format). 

See the command SET FILE_DIRECTORY for info  on  setting  the  directory
where files are stored.   The default directory is SYS$LOGIN.
2 /FEEDBACK
Used only in conjunction with /GROUP.  Specifies to show when  new  news
groups are selected. 
2 /FOLDERS
Lists the available message folders.  Shows last message date and number
of  messages  in  folder.   An asterisk (*) next to foldername indicates
that there are unread messages in  that  folder.   This  will  not  show
newsgroups.  To see newsgroups, use the NEWS command or DIR/NEWS.
2 /FROM
 /FROM=[string]

Specifies that only messages whose username contains the specified string
are to be displayed.  This cannot be used in conjunction with /MARKED.  
If no string is specified, the previously specified string is used.

2 /GROUP
   /GROUP=(string,[...])

Specifies a list of groups  to  be  searched.    Used  with  the  search
qualifiers  /SEARCH, /SUBJECT, or /FROM.  Wildcards are permitted in the
specified string.  Use /FEEDBACK to see when groups are  selected.    At
any  time  during the search you may enter other commands, i.e.  you may
read a message, see a full directory listing, etc.  You may then restart
the  search  listing by typing DIR/CONTINUE.  For more info, see help on
the /CONTINUOUS qualifier. 
2 /NEGATED
Used with /SUBJECT, /FROM, & /SEARCH.  If specified, messages who don't
match the specified search command are displayed.
2 /MARKED
Lists messages that have been marked (indicated by an asterisk).
This is equivalent to selecting the folder with /MARKED, i.e. only
marked messages will be shown and be able to be read.  To see all
messages, use either /ALL, or reselect the folder. 
2 /UNMARKED
Lists messages that have not been marked (marked messages are indicated
by an asterisk).  Using /UNMARKED is equivalent to selecting the folder
with /UNMARKED, i.e. only unmarked messages will be shown and be able
to be read.  To see all messages, use either /ALL, or reselect the
folder. 
2 /SEEN
Lists messages that have been seen (indicated by a greater than sign). 
Using /SEEN is equivalent to selecting the folder with /SEEN, i.e. only
seen messages will be shown and be able to be read.  To see all
messages, use either /ALL, or reselect the folder.

2 /NEW
Specifies  to  start  the  listing  of  messages  with  the first unread
message.
2 /NEWS
Lists the available news groups.  This does the same thing as  the  NEWS
command.  See that command for qualifiers which apply.
2 /OUTPUT
 /OUTPUT=filename

Specifies to write the directory output to a file rather than the
terminal.
2 /PRINT
Specifies that the text of the messages which are found by the
DIRECTORY command are to be printed.  All qualifiers which are valid
for the PRINT command are valid in conjunction with /PRINT.  The list
of messages to be printed will be displayed on the terminal (in
nopaging format). 
2 /REPLY
Specifies that only messages which are replies to the current message
are to be displayed.  This cannot be used in conjunction with /MARKED.
2 /NOREPLIES
Specifies that only messages which are not replies (i.e. whose subject
do not start with RE:) are to be displayed.  This cannot be used in 
conjunction with /MARKED.
2 /SEARCH
 /SEARCH=[string]

Specifies that only messages which contain the specified string are
to be displayed.  This cannot be used in conjunction with /MARKED.
If no string is specified, the previously specified string is used.
See also /NEGATED.
2 /SINCE

Displays a listing of all the messages created on or after the
specified date.  If no date is specified, the default is TODAY.
2 /START
 /START=message_number

Indicates the first message number you want to display.  For example,
to  display  all the messages beginning with number three, enter the
command line DIRECTORY/START=3.  Not valid with /FOLDER.
2 /SUBJECT
 /SUBJECT=[string]

Specifies that only messages which contain the specified string in  it's
subject  header are to be displayed.  This cannot be used in conjunction
with /MARKED.  If no  string  is  specified,  the  previously  specified
string is used. 
1 EXCLUDE
Specifies to exclude reading messages based on the message owner or  the
subject.  If it is determined that a message is to be excluded, then the
message is skipped when a user tries to read a message bytyping NEXT  or
BACK,  or by hitting the return key.  Specify /FULL to make all EXCLUDEs
and INCLUDEs for the  specified  folder  apply  to  all  other  BULLETIN
commands, including directory listings.

  Format:
    EXCLUDE [string]

If a string is specified, then the message is excluded if the  owner  or
the subject contains that string, depending on whether /FROM or /SUBJECT
is specified.  Otherwise, if no string is specified, then the owner name
or subject of the current message is used.  /FROM is the default.

Note:  EXCLUDEs take precedence over INCLUDEs.
2 /ALL
Used with /DISABLE to specify to disable all EXCLUDEs.
2 /DISABLE
Specifies to permanently disable the EXCLUDE.
2 /FROM
Specifies to exclude the message based on the message owner.  This is
the default.  /FROM and /SUBJECT cannot be specified at the same time.
2 /FULL
If specified, causes all excludes and includes for the  selected  folder
to  be  applied  to all BULLETIN commands, including directory listings.
See help customizing for info on how to make this the  default  for  all
folders.    Note  that  specifying  this  may  substantially  slow  down
directory listings.  When /FULL is specified, the EXCLUDE  command  will
not add an exclude,  so it can't be used with any other qualifier except
for /DISABLE.
2 /LIMIT
   /LIMIT=days

Specifies that the exclude will be automatically deleted if no match  is
found  for the specified number of days.  The default is no limit, which
is specified by 0.  This can be changed via the SET EXLIMIT command. 
2 /SUBJECT
Specifies to exclude the message based on the message subject.  /FROM
and /SUBJECT cannot be specified at the same time. 
2 Storing_EXCLUDEs
EXCLUDEs are stored in the file SYS$LOGIN:BULL.CUSTOM or in the file
pointed to by the logical name BULL_USER_CUSTOM.  The format is:

folder_name:EXCLUDE:FROM(or SUBJECT):string

In order for /FULL to be the default for a folder, the following line
must be present:

folder_name:defaults:kill

excluding the folder_name causes it to apply to all folders.
1 EXIT
Exits the BULLETIN program.
1 EXTRACT
Synonym for FILE command.
1 FILE
Copies the current message to the named file.  If the file  exists,  the
message is appended to the file, unless the /NEW qualifier is specified. 

  Format:
    FILE [filename] [message_number][-message_number1],[...]

If the filename is omitted, a file will be created based on the name  of
the folder. 

A range of messages to be copied can optionally be specified, i.e.  FILE
2-5.  The key words CURRENT and LAST can also be specified in the range,
in place of an actual number, i.e. CURRENT-LAST, 1-CURRENT, etc. 

See the command SET FILE_DIRECTORY for info  on  setting  the  directory
where files are stored.   The default directory is SYS$LOGIN.
2 /ALL
Copies all the messages in the current folder.
2 /FF
Specifies that a form feed is placed between messages in the file.
2 /HEADER
 /[NO]HEADER

Controls whether a header containing the owner, subject, and date of the 
message is written in the file.  The default is to write the header.
2 /NEW

Specifies that a new file is to be created.  Otherwise, if the specified
file exists, the file would be appended to that file.
1 FIRST
Specifies that the first message in the folder is to be read.
1 Folders
All messages are divided into separate folders.    New  folders  can  be
created  by any user.  As an example, the following creates a folder for
GAMES related messages: 
                                               
BULLETIN> CREATE GAMES
Enter a one line description of folder.
GAMES

To see the list of available folders, use DIRECTORY/FOLDERS.  To  select
a specific folder, use the SELECT command. 

If a user selects a folder and enters the SET READNEW command, that user
will  be  alerted of topics of new messages at login time, and will then
be given the option of reading them.  Similar  to  READNEW  is  SHOWNEW,
which displays the topics but doesn't prompt to read them.  Even less is
SET BRIEF, which will cause only a one line output indicating that there
are  new  messages  in the folder.  There also is the SET NOTIFY option,
which will cause a message to be broadcast to a user's terminal alerting
the user that a new message has been added.  Any of these options can be
the default for the folder by using the /DEFAULT switch on the command. 

A folder can be restricted to only certain users, if desired.   This  is
done  by specifying CREATE/PRIVATE.  Afterwards, access to the folder is
controlled by the creator by the SET [NO]ACCESS command.  If instead you
specify /SEMIPRIVATE, all users can read the messages in the folder, but
only those given access can add messages. 

A folder can be converted into a remote folder using CREATE/NODE or  SET
NODE.    A  remote  folder  is  one which points to a folder on a remote
DECNET node.  Messages added to a remote node are actually stored on the
folder   on   the   remote   node.    The  BULLCP  process  (created  by
BULLETIN/STARTUP) must be running on the remote node for this option  to
be used. 

A folder can be specified as a SYSTEM folder, i.e. one in which  SYSTEM/
SHUTDOWN/BROADCAST messages can be added.  One use for this is to create
a remote SYSTEM folder which is shared by all nodes, so that the default
folder is used for messages pertaining only to the local host, while the
remote folder is used for messages pertaining to all nodes.  Another use
is  to  create  a  folder  for  posting SYSTEM messages only meant for a
certain UIC group.  This is done by creating a  PRIVATE  SYSTEM  folder,
and  giving access to that UIC group.  Only users in that UIC group will
see the messages in that folder when they log in. 
1 FORWARD
Synonym for MAIL command.
1 HELP
To obtain help on any topic, type:

        HELP  topic
1 INCLUDE
This command is a synonym for the THREAD command.
1 INDEX
Gives directory listing of all folders or subscribed groups in
alphabetical order.  Useful for scanning your folders or news groups for 
new messages without having to manually select them.  If the INDEX
command is re-entered while the INDEX scan is in progress, the scan will
skip to the next folder.  This is useful for skipping past a folder.  It
also can be used to continue the scan from where one left off after one
has read a message.  /RESTART must be specified to start from the first
folder if a scan is in progress.  All other qualifiers are ignored while 
a scan is in progress.

  Format:
       INDEX

When a directory is displayed, you can read the first message in the 
list by typing READ.

NOTE:  /NEW and /SET are the defaults.  This was not the case for older
versions of BULLETIN.
2 /MARKED
Lists messages that have been marked (marked messages are indicated by
an asterisk).  This is equivalent to selecting the folder with /MARKED,
i.e. only marked messages will be shown and be able to be read. 
2 /UNMARKED
Lists messages that have not been marked (marked messages are indicated
by an asterisk).  Using /UNMARKED is equivalent to selecting the folder
with /UNMARKED, i.e. only unmarked messages will be shown and be able
to be read.
2 /SEEN
Lists messages that have been seen (indicated by a greater than sign). 
Using /SEEN is equivalent to selecting the folder with /SEEN, i.e. only
seen messages will be shown and be able to be read.
2 /UNSEEN
Lists messages that have not been seen (seen message are indicated by a
greater than sign). Using /UNSEEN is equivalent to selecting the folder
with /UNSEEN, i.e. only unseen messages will be shown and be able to be
read.
2 /NEW
 /[NO]NEW

Specifies to list only those folders or groups that have new unread
messages, and to start the listing with the first unread message.
Otherwise, the listing will start with the first message.  /NEW is the
default.  Is ignored if /[UN]SEEN or /[UN]MARKED are specified.
2 /RESTART
If specified, causes the listing to be reinitialized and start from the
first folder.
2 /SET
 /[NO]SET

Specifies that only folders that have READNEW, BRIEF, or SHOWNEW set are
to be shown.  SET is the default.  Ignored if /SUBSCRIBE is specified.
2 /SUBSCRIBE
If specified, lists only news groups which have been subscribed to.

DEFINE/KEY COMMA "SPAWN"/TERM
1 LAST

Displays the last message in the current folder.

  Format:
       LAST
2 /EDIT
Specifies that the editor is to be used to read the message.  This is
useful for scanning a long message.
2 /HEADER
 /[NO]HEADER

Specifies that if a message header exists, the header will be shown.
If /HEADER or /NOHEADER is specified, the setting will apply for all
further reads in the selected folder.  The default is /HEADER for non-
NEWS folders, /NOHEADER for NEWS folders.  If the SET STRIP command
is set for the folder, it will change the default to be /HEADER.
A user can make this option the default for a particular folder or
news group.  See HELP Customizing.
2 /ROTATE
Specifies to decode the message using ROT-13 coding.
1 MAIL
Invokes the VAX/VMS Personal Mail Utility (MAIL) to send the message
which you are reading to the specified recipients.

  Format:

    MAIL recipient-name[s]

The input for the recipient name is exactly the same format as used by
the MAIL command at DCL level.  Note that this means when specifying an
address that has quotes, in order to pass the quotes you must specify
triple quotes.  I.e. a network address of the form xxx%"address" must
be specified as xxx%"""address""".
2 /EDIT
Specifies that the editor is to be used to edit the message before
mailing it.
2 /HEADER
 /[NO]HEADER

Controls whether a header containing the owner, subject, and date of the 
message is written in the mail.  The default is to write the header.
2 /SUBJECT
 /SUBJECT=text

Specifies the subject of the mail message. If the text consists of more
than one word, enclose the text in quotation marks (").

If you omit this qualifier, the description of the message will be used
as the subject.
1 MARK
Sets the current or message-id message as marked. Marked messages are
displayed with an asterisk in the left hand column of the directory
listing.  A marked message can serve as a reminder of important
information.  The UNMARK command sets the current or message-id message
as unmarked.

   Format:

       MARK [message-number or numbers]
       UNMARK [message-number or numbers]

NOTE: The list of marked messages for non-NEWS folders are stored in a
file username.BULLMARK, and NEWS folders are stored in
username.NEWSMARK. The files are created in the directory pointed to by
the logical name BULL_MARK.  If BULL_MARK is not defined, SYS$LOGIN
will be used. 
1 MODIFY
Modifies the database information for the current folder.  Only the
owner of the folder or a user with privileges can use this command. 

  Format:

    MODIFY
2 /DESCRIPTION
Specifies a new description for the folder.  You will be prompted for
the text of the description.

NOTE: If this folder is to receive messages from a network mailing  list
via  the  BBOARD  feature, and you wish to use the POST and RESPOND/LIST
commands, the address of the mailing list  should  be  included  in  the
description.  This is done by enclosing the address using <> and placing
it at the end of the description, i.e. 

              INFOVAX MAILING LIST <INFO-VAX@KL.SRI.COM>

You can also use this feature to have messages  which  are  added  to  a
folder  to automatically mailed to the email address.  This is common if
you have users that don't have access to BULLETIN.  In order to do this,
you should use the SET ADD_ONLY command.  This causes all messages added
to the folder to also be sent to the email address.  This  also  applies
to  messages which are added via the BBOARD feature.  In this way, users
without access to BULLETIN can add  messages  by  sending  mail  to  the
BBOARD account.  Please also read about the SET GATEWAY command.
2 /ID
Designates that the name specified as the owner name is a rights
identifier.  The creator's process must have the identifier presently
assigned to it.  Any process which has that identifier assigned to it
will be able to control the folder as if it were the folder's owner.
This is used to allow more than one use to control a folder.

Note: This feature will not work during remote access to the folder.
2 /NAME
 /NAME=foldername

Specifies a new name for the folder.
2 /OWNER
 /OWNER=username

Specifies a new owner for the folder.  If the owner does not have
privileges, BULLETIN will prompt for the password of the new owner
account in order to okay the modification.  See also /ID.
1 MOVE
Moves a message to another  folder  and  deletes  it  from  the  current
folder. 

  Format:

    MOVE folder-name [message_number][-message_number1]

The folder-name is the name of the folder to which the message is to  be
be  moved to.  Optionally, a range of messages which are to be moved can
be specified  following  the  folder  name,  i.e.  COPY  NEWFOLDER  2-5.
However,  if  the  old  folder  is  remote,  they will be copied but not
deleted, as only one message can be delted from a  remote  folder  at  a
time. 

The key words CURRENT and LAST can also be specified in  the  range,  in
place of an actual number, i.e. CURRENT-LAST, 1-CURRENT, etc. 
2 /ALL
Specifies to move all the messages from the old folder.  Note:  If the
old folder is remote, they will be copied but not deleted, as only one
message can be deleted from a remote folder at a time.
2 /GROUPS
 /GROUPS=(newsgroup,[...])

Valid only if a NEWS group is selected.  Specifies to send the message to
the specified NEWS group(s) in addition to the selected NEWS group.
2 /HEADER
 /[NO]HEADER

Valid only if destination folder is a news group.  Specifies that header
of message is to be included with the text when the text is copied.
The default is /NOHEADER.
2 /LOCAL
If specified and destination is a folder, the message will only be moved
to the folder, and will not be emailed to a corresponding email address or
sent to a an associated news group, if either is present for the folder.
If the destination is a news group, message header has line added to it
to avoid having the message from being copied to a folder which has that
news group feeding to it.
2 /MERGE
Specifies that the original date and time of the moved messages are
saved and that the messages are placed in correct chronological order 
in the new folder.  This operation is lengthy if the new folder is large.
2 /ORIGINAL
Specifies that the owner of the moved message will be the original owner
of the message.  The default is that the moved message will be owned by
the person moving the message.
1 NEWS
Displays the list of available news groups.

Format:

	NEWS [string]

If  the  string is specified, lists news groups whose name contains that
string.  If the string contains an asterisk, a wild card match  will  be
applied.   I.e.  if ALT* is specified, all groups starting with ALT will
be displayed.

The status column of the display shows the status  of  the  news  group.
"y"  means  the  news  group  is available.  "m" means the news group is
moderated, and posting may or may not  be  allowable.    "="  means  the
newsgroup  has  been renamed.  The new name is shown on the display line
immediately following the old name. 

Only those news groups which are enabled are shown.   Adding  /ALL  will
show both enabled and disabled groups.  If this is done, the status will
show "x" if the group has been deactived by the news  server  feed,  and
"n" if the group has been deactived locally. 
2 /ALL
If specified, all news groups will be shown, including those that have
been disabled.
2 /CLASS
If specified, will show news group classes.  For more info on classes,
see help for SET NEWS/CLASS.
2 /COUNT
If specified, will show number of messages in the news group instead
of the status.
2 /DEFAULT
If specified, will show news groups that have be defined as default 
groups using the SET SUBSCRIBE command.
2 /NEWGROUP
If specified, will list new news groups that have been added since the
last time that a user has accessed a news group.  If there are new
groups, a user will see a message indicating that there are new groups
when the user accesses a news group.
2 /PERMANENT
If specified, will show news groups that have be defined as permanent
groups using the SET SUBSCRIBE command.
2 /START
 /START=string

If specified, the list will start with the  first  group  which  follows
alphabetically  after  that  string.  I.e. if /START=B is specified, the
list will start with groups whose name starts with a B.
2 /STORED
If specified, only those news groups which are stored on disk are shown.
2 /SUBSCRIBE
If specified, lists only those news folders which have been subscribed to.
An asterisk before the group indicates that new messages are present for
that folder.
1 New_features
Here is a list of new features which may be of interest to the general 
BULLETIN user.  If you find a bug or have a good suggestion for a new 
feature, send mail to MRL@PFC.MIT.EDU.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
V 2.24
Removed INCLUDE command and replaced it with the THREAD command.    This
allows  you  to  save  and  easily  read new messages in threads via the
READ/THREADS command.  11/13/95

V 2.23
Added /LIMIT to EXCLUDE and also the SET EXLIMIT command.   These  allow
excludes to be specified so that they expire after a specified amount of
days.  The SHOW EXCLUDE now will show the last time a message was found 
that matched the exclude.  8/16/95

Added /GROUP qualifier to DIRECTORY command to allow  specifying  groups
to search using wild cards names.  8/3/95

Added /GROUP qualifier to SEARCH command to allow specifying  groups  to
search using wild cards names.  6/20/95

V 2.22
