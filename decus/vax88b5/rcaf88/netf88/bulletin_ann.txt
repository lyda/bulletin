Subject: BULLETIN utility.

You are about to receive version 1.52 of the PFC BULLETIN.

BULLETIN   is   public   domain   software.    (I   will  gladly  accept
recommendations for new features,  not  for  changes  that  are  due  to
"personal" preference.)

If  you  are  running  an  older  version of BULLETIN, this version will
modify the format of some of the data files.  This can cause problems if
the  old  version  of  BULLETIN  is  run  after the data files have been
modified.  Such a situation is possible on a cluster where each node has
installed  the  executable  separately.   To  help  installation,  a new
command procedure INSTALL_REMOTE.COM has been  included.   This  can  be
used  to install BULLETIN on several nodes from a single node.  Read the
comments in the file for information on how to use it.

(The format of the .BULLDIR will change.  After successful installation,
the  older  versions  of these files can be removed.  This format change
can take a significant amount of time if the folder is large.   If  your
site  has  large  folders,  it  is  suggested  that  the  new version be
installed during off peak hours.)

(The latest feature and bug fixes for this new version are listed later.)

You will be receiving 14 files (NOT NECESSARILY IN THIS ORDER!):
	1) BULLETIN.FOR
	2) BULLETIN0.FOR
	3) BULLETIN1.FOR
	4) BULLETIN2.FOR
	5) BULLETIN3.FOR
	6) BULLETIN4.FOR
	7) BULLETIN5.FOR
	8) BULLETIN6.FOR
	9) BULLETIN7.FOR
	10) BULLETIN8.FOR
	11) BULLETIN9.FOR
	12) ALLMACS.MAR
	13) BULLCOMS1.HLP
	14) BULLCOMS2.HLP
	15) BULLET1.COM
	16) BULLET2.COM

(They will be  identified  in  the  SUBJECT  header.)   BULLET1.COM  and
BULLET2.COM  are  command procedures which when run, will create several
small files.  After you run it, you can delete it.   Read  AAAREADME.TXT
for installation instructions.

NOTE: When creating these files (using the EXTRACT command) from the VMS
MAIL utility, you will have to strip  off  any  mail  headers  that  are
present, including blank lines.  A command procedure is included at this
end of this message which can be run which uses EDT to do this for  you.

V1.52

Made modifications so it would work with VMS V5.0.

Modified structure of directory files for folders.  The files are now
keyed files, the keys being message number and message date.  This speeds
up the process of searching for a message using a date.  Thus, BULLETIN is
now more efficient when it has to find the latest message in a folder.

Modified cleanup algorithm.  Old code could cause file corruption.

Add /SUBJECT in SEARCH command to search only the description of messages.

Add /DESCRIPTION and /OWNER in CREATE command.

Corrected problem that would cause invalid notification of new messages
in a remote SYSTEM folder.  If a new SYSTEM message was added, and a person
entered BULLETIN, it would notify the user that there was a new message in
the folder even though the SYSTEM message had been displayed during logging
in.  To correct this, the BULLFOLDER.DAT format had to be changed to store
the date of the last non-SYSTEM message in each folder.

Added logical name BULL_DISABLE to disable use of BULLETIN.  Useful during
installation (or debugging) of BULLETIN.  Also added command procedure
INSTALL_REMOTE.COM.  These two should make it easier to install a new version
of BULLETIN in a cluster, where INSTALL must be run on each node to install
the new executable.  This is especially important when the new executable
changes the format of the data file, so that the old version must not be run
after the data format has been changed.

Fixed bug which caused NOTIFY flag for GENERAL folder to be cleared.

Fixed bug which would cause /SUBJECT not to work in MAIL command if placed
after the username.  Also added /HEADER qualifier to MAIL to include the
message header with the message.

Fixed bug which prevented messages with expiration years > 1999 from being
deleted (without /IMMEDITATE).

Fixed bug which was causing expired messages from not being deleted.

Fixed bug which allows non-privileged user to copy a permanent message such
that the copy messaged kept the permanent designation.

Fixed BBOARD algorithm which required the username in the "To:" mail message
field to be uppercase.  Some non-DEC mail systems use lowercase.

When creating a remote folder, i.e. CREATE/NODE, and the actual folder on
the remote node is PRIVATE, this information will now be displayed via the
SHOW FOLDER command.

Fixed bug in BULLCP which resulted in subprocess BULL_CLEANUP to be spawned.
This should only occur if BULLCP is not running.  BULLCP itself does the
cleanup of empty space in folders, so this was redundant and time consuming.

Added /TEXT qualifier to REPLY command (and, as a consequence, also to the
ADD command).  This is present in the RESPOND command, and includes the text
of the previously read message into the new message.  Also, the text of the
old message is indented using ">"s, which can be suppressed with /NOINDENT.

If files are shared between nodes in a cluster, SHUTDOWN messages were not
deleted at the appropriate times, as there was no way of knowing from 
which node the messages were submitted from.  This has been fixed so that
SHUTDOWN messages will be deleted when the node they were submitted from
is rebooted.

KEYPAD mode has been added.  Keypad can be enabled so that keys are assigned
to BULLETIN commands.  This canenabled either by the SET KEYPAD command, or by
adding /KEYPAD to the command line.  SHOW KEYPAD shows the definitions.

Fixed bug which caused BULLCP not to be able to update a private folder after
BULLCP was used by a remote user.  (During a remote access, BULLCP sets it's
privileges to that of the user's proxy login who is doing the access.  It was
not getting set back to BULLCP's actual privileges.)

Did you know that access to a folder can be resticted to a particular DECNET
node?  This is because interactive processes are assigned the SYS$NODE_nodename
id, and that id can be specified via a SET ACCESS command.
