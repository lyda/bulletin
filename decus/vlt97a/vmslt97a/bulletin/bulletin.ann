Article 168253 of comp.os.vms:
BULLETIN is a bulletin board utility which I wrote for VMS.  However,  because
many  of  our VAX users moved to PCs and MACs, they have wanted access to read
and post to the BULLETIN folders.  In the past I accomplished this  via  EMAIL
and  used  the  feature  which  allowed  mail to be sent to and from a folder.
However, some people have asked for Web access.  In order  to  easily  provide
this  feature  without  a  lot of work, we decided to do the following:  Since
news server software is now easily  and  cheapily  available,  and  most  news
readers  (i.e. Netscape) have the ability to read usenet news groups from more
than one news server, I set up a local  news  server  to  serve  private  news
groups.   I then modified BULLETIN to allow a folder with email access to also
have the ability to post and receive to a specified news group.  I also had to
modify BULLETIN to allow it to access more than one news server.  Thus, a user
can now post and read the same folder either via either  BULLETIN,  EMAIL,  or
WEB access via a newsgroup. 

The new version of BULLETIN (v2.3) which has this  feature  is  available  via
anonymous ftp to PSFC.MIT.EDU in the BULLETIN sub-directory. 

Note:  The newsgroup-folder feature had existed in the past but would not work
with  email.  It also was crude in that if you added a message, it would first
post the message to the newsgroup and then later be added to the folder.    It
now is added immediately to the folder.  Sharp users will note that this gives
BULLETIN the ability to be used as a newsgroup to mailing list gateway.
