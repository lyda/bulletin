This message is being displayed by the BULLETIN facility.  This is a non-DEC
facility, so it is not described in the manuals.  System messages, such as this
one, are displayed in full.  Only topics will be displayed for non-system
messages.  Messages are submitted using the BULLETIN command.  Any user may
submit a non-system message.  Only privileged users can submit a system
message. For more information, see the on-line help (via HELP BULLETIN).
