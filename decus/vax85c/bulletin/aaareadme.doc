The following are instructions for creating the BULLETIN executable and 
installation of the utility.  A brief explanation of how the internals
of the BULLETIN utility works can be found in BULLETIN.TXT .  None of
the command procedures included here are sophisticated, so it is likely
that several modifications will have to be made by the installer.
The installer should enable all privileges before installation.

1) CREATE.COM
   This will compile and link the BULLETIN sources. Also, there are severalu
   INCLUDE files for the fortran sources (.INC files). BULLFILES.INC must first 
   be modified before this procedure is run. It contains the names of data files
   which BULLETIN creates. It also has the username for the BBOARD account.t
   BBOARD is an option by which mail sent to the specified username will bet
   converted into bulletins.  This allows a user on a different system, which is
   connected via a network, to be able to submit a bulletin.  This feature can
   be disabled if it is not desired by specifying the username NONE.  In any
   case, you should edit BULLFILES.INC and specify the appropriate device ands
   directories in which you desire that the files be located.  (NOTE: Although
   the BBOARD feature can be used over DECNET, a more sophisticated method
   is available to easily allow one to add bulletins to other DECNET nodes
   with all the features of BULLETIN.  See below).

2) STARTUP.COM
   The data files that BULLETIN creates should be owned by a system UIC,
   and MUST be protected from users being able to have access them.L
   STARTUP.COM sets the process UIC to [1,4] (you should change this ifc
   you want something else), sets the WORLD and GROUP protection to NONE,t
   adds the bulletin found in the file INSTRUCT.TXT (it is added withl
   /PERMANENT, so it never expires), and then resets the UIC and PROTECTION 
   to what they were before running the procedure.
   INSTRUCT.BUL contains a bulletin with instructions to the users as to
   how to use the BULLETIN utility.  You may want to modify it. 

3) INSTALL.COM
   The following procedure copies the executable image to SYS$SYSTEM and
   installs it with certain privileges.  It also installs the necessaryh
   help files in SYS$HELP.

4) LOGIN.COM
   This contains the comands that should be executed at login time
   by SYS$MANAGER:SYLOGIN.COM.  It defines the BULLETIN commands.d
   It also executes the command BULLETIN/LOGIN in order to notifyu
   the user of new bulletins.  If desired, the /READNEW qualifierd
   can also be added.  If there are any new non-system bulletins, this
   qualifier creates a prompt asking the user if the non-systemv
   bulletins are to be displayed or not.  Normally, only system bulletinsç
   are displayed in full, and only the subjects of the non-systema
   bulletins are displayed.  ( Some systems might have a lot of userso
   who are not interested in reading the non-system bulletins, in 
   which case /READNEW should probably not be added.  Instead, you could
   let users enable this feature by entering the BULLETIN utility andh
   typing the command SET READNEW ).  (NOTE: Since /LOGIN and /READNEW
   are system commands, they are not included in the help file).

5) BULLSTART.COM
   This procedure contains the commands that should be executed afterd
   a system startup.  It should be executed by SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP.COM
   as a batch job.  It simply installs the BULLETIN utility with correct
   privileges.

6) BULLETIN.COMc
   If one wants the feature of using BULLETIN between DECNET nodes,t
   this file must be put in each node's DECNET default user's directoryA
   (usually [DECNET]).  Once this is done, the /NODE qualifer for the
   ADD command can be used.i
   NOTE:  Presently, privileged functions such as /SYSTEM will worka
   on other nodes only if you have an account on the other node with
   the same username, and with appropriate privileges.  You will bet
   prompted for the password for the account on the remote node.  However,
   due to unknown reasons, the software I have to check the password will'
   only work for passwords that have been set under V4.x.  If the password
   was created under V3.x, the program will not work, and you password wills
   be treated as invalid.u
