1 ADD
Adds a message to the specified folder.  A file can be specified which
contains the message.  Otherwise, BULLETIN will prompt for the text.
BULLETIN will ask for an expiration date and a header to contain the
topic of the message.

  Format:
    ADD [file-name]

All the qualifiers except for /EDIT and /NODES are restricted to users
with SETPRV privileges.
2 /ALL
This option is restricted to privileged users.  It is used in conjunction
with the /BROADCAST qualifier.  If specified, all terminals are sent the
message.  Otherwise, only users are sent the message.
2 /BELL
This option is restricted to privileged users.  It is used in conjunction 
with the /BROADCAST qualifier.  If specified, the bell is rung on the 
terminals when the message is broadcasted.
2 /BROADCAST
This option is restricted to privileged users and SYSTEM folders.  If
specified, a message is both stored and broadcasted to all users logged
in at the time.  If the folder is remote, a message will be broadcast on
all nodes which are connected to that folder, unless /LOCAL is specified.
A node which does not have BULLCP running cannot have a message
broadcasted to it, (even though it is able to create a remote folder).

See also /ALL and /BELL.
2 /CLUSTER
 /[NO]CLUSTER

This option specifies that broadcasted messages should be sent to all
nodes in the cluster.  /CLUSTER is the default.
2 /EDIT
 /[NO]EDIT
Determines whether or not the editor is invoked to edit the message
you are adding.  /EDIT is the default if you have added /EDIT to your
BULLETIN command line.
2 /EXPIRATION
 /EXPIRATION=time

Specifies the time at which the message is to expire.  Either absolute
time: [dd-mmm-yyyy] hh:mm:ss, or delta time: dddd [hh:mm:ss] can be
used.
2 /FOLDER
 /FOLDER=(foldername,[...])

Specifies the foldername into which the message is to be added.  Does not
change the current selected folder.  Folders can be either local or
remote folders.  Thus, a nodename can precede the foldername (this assumes
that the remote node is capable of supporting this feature, i.e. the BULLCP
process is running on that node.  If it is not, you will receive an error
message).  If the the foldername is specified with only a nodename,
i.e. FOO::, the foldername is assumed to be GENERAL.  NOTE:  Specifying
remote nodes is only possible if that remote node is running a special
BULLCP process.  If it isn't, the only way to add messages to that remote
node is via the /NODE command.  However, /FOLDER is a much quicker method,
and much more versatile.

You can specify logical names which translate to one or more folder names.
I.e.  $ DEFINE ALL_FOLDERS "VAX1,VAX2,VAX3", and then specify /NODES=
ALL_FOLDERS.  Note that the quotation marks are required.

When using /FOLDER for remote nodes, proxy logins are used to determine
if privileged options are allowed.  If they are not allowed, the message
will still be added, but without the privileged settings.
2 /LOCAL

Specifies that when /BROADCAST is specified for a remote folder, the
message is broadcasted ONLY on the local node.
2 /NODES
 /NODES=(nodes[,...])

Specifies to send the message to the listed DECNET nodes.  The BULLETIN
utility must be installed properly on the other nodes.  (See installation
notes). You can specify a different username to use at the other nodes by
either using the USERNAME qualifier, or by specifying the nodename with 2
semi-colons followed by the username, i.e. nodename::username.  If you
specify a username, you will be prompted for the password of the account
on the other nodes.

Additionally, you can specify logical names which translate to one or
more node names.  I.e.  $ DEFINE ALL_NODES "VAX1,VAX2,VAX3", and then
specify /NODES=ALL_NODES.  Note that the quotation marks are required.

NOTE: It is preferable to use /FOLDER instead of /NODE if possible,
since adding messages via /FOLDER is much quicker.
2 /NOINDENT
See /TEXT for information on this qualifier.
2 /PERMANENT
This option is restricted to privileged users for the GENERAL folder,
but available to all in other folders.  If specified, message will be a
permanent message and will never expire.
2 /SUBJECT
 /SUBJECT=description

Specifies the subject of the message to be added.
2 /SHUTDOWN
This option is restricted to privileged users.  If specified, message
will be automatically deleted after a computer shutdown has occurred.
This option is restricted to SYSTEM folders.

NOTE:  If the bulletin files are shared between cluster nodes, the
message will be deleted after the node on which the message was
submitted from is rebooted.  If the folder is a remote folder, the
message will be deleted after the remote node reboots, not the node
from which the message was added.
2 /SYSTEM
This option is restricted to privileged users.  If specified, message
is both saved in the folder and displayed in full as a system message
when a user logs in.  System messages should be as brief as possible to
avoid the possibility that system messages could scroll off the screen.
This option is restricted to SYSTEM folders.
2 /TEXT
Specifies that the text of the previously read message should be included
at the beginning of the new message.  The previous message must be in the
same folder.  This qualifier is valid only when used with /EDIT.  The
text is indented with > at the beginning of each line.  This can be
suppressed with /NOINDENT.
2 /USERNAME
Specifies username to be used at remote DECNET nodes when adding messages
to DECNET nodes via the /NODE qualifier.
1 BACK
Displays the message preceding the current message.
1 BULLETIN
The BULLETIN utility permits a user to create a message for reading by
all users.  Users are notified upon logging in that new messages have
been added, and what the topic of the messages are.  Actual reading of
the messages is optional. (See the command SET READNEW for info on
automatic reading.)  Messages are automatically deleted when their
expiration date has passed.
1 CHANGE
Replaces or modifies existing stored message.  This is for changing part
or all of a message without causing users who have already seen the
message to be notified of it a second time.  If the text of the message
is to be changed, a file can be specified which contains the text.
Otherwise, you will be prompted for the text.  The expiration info and
header can also be changed.  If neither no qualifiers are added to the
command, it is assumed the whole message will be replaced.

  Format:
    CHANGE [file-name]
2 /EDIT
 /[NO]EDIT
Determines whether or not the editor is invoked to edit the message
you are replacing.  The old message text is read into the editor unless
a file-name or /NEW is specified.  /EDIT is the default if you have
added /EDIT to your BULLETIN command line.
2 /EXPIRATION
 /EXPIRATION[=time]

Specifies the time at which the message is to expire.  Either absolute
time: [dd-mmm-yyyy] hh:mm:ss, or delta time: dddd [hh:mm:ss] can be
used.  If no time is specified, you will be prompted for the time.
2 /GENERAL
Specifies that the message is to be converted from a SYSTEM message to
a GENERAL message.  This only applies to the GENERAL folder.
2 /HEADER
Specifies that the message header is to be replaced.  You will be
prompted for the new message description.
2 /NEW
If the editor is to be used for replacing the text of the message,
NEW specifies not to read in the old message text, and that a totally
new text is to be read in.
2 /NUMBER
 /NUMBER=message_number

Specifies the message number to be replaced.  If this qualifier is L
omitted, the message that is presently being read will be replaced.O
2 /PERMANENT
Specifies that the message is to be made permanent.v
2 /SHUTDOWNA
Specifies that the message is to expire after the next computerF
shutdown.  This option is restricted to SYSTEM folders.T
2 /SUBJECT
 /SUBJECT=description

Specifies the subject of the message to be added.
2 /SYSTEMN
Specifies that the message is to be made a SYSTEM message.  This is ah
privileged command and is restricted to SYSTEM folders.i
2 /TEXTs
Specifies that the message text is to be replaced.
1 COPY
Copies a message to another folder  without  deleting  it  from  the
current folder.

  Format:

    COPY folder-name [message_number][-message_number1] 

The folder-name is the name of the folder to which the message is to beo
copied to.  Optionally, a range of messages which are to be copied can bet
specified following the folder name, i.e. COPY NEWFOLDER 2-5.t
2 /ALL
Specifies to copy all the messages in the old folder.B
2 /MERGE
Specifies that the original date and time of the copied messages are
saved and that the messages are placed in correct chronological order 
in the new folder.  This operation is lengthy if the new folder is large.r
2 /ORIGINALp
Specifies that the owner of the copied message will be the original ownere
of the message.  The default is that the copied message will be owned by
the person copying the message.s
1 CREATE
Creates a folder of messages.  This is similar to the folders in the VMS
MAIL utility.  Folders are often created so that messages of a similar
topic are grouped separately, or to restrict reading of certain messages
to specified users.  Once created, that message is automatically selectedb
(see information on SELECT command).  The commands that can be used to
modify the folder's characteristics are: MODIFY, REMOVE, SET ACCESS,
SET BBOARD, SET NODE, and SET SYSTEM.g

  Format:d
    CREATE folder-name

The folder-name is limited to 25 letters and must not include spaces or
characters that are also invalid in filenames (this is because the foldere
is stored in a file name created with the folder name).a

NOTE: Creation of folders may be a restricted command if the installer
has elected to install it as such.  This is done by modifying BULLCOM.CLD.
2 /BRIEF
Specifies that all users automatically have BRIEF set for this folder.
Only a privileged user can use this qualifier.  (See HELP SET BRIEF for
more information.)
2 /DESCRIPTION
 /DESCRIPTION=description.

Specifies the description of the folder, which is displayed using thec
SHOW FOLDER command.  If omitted, you are prompted for a description. 

NOTE: If this folder is to receive messages from a network mailing listS
via the BBOARD feature, and you wish to use the POST and RESPOND/LISTg
commands, the address of the mailing list should be included in thes
description.  This is done by enclosing the address using <> and
placing it at the end of the description, i.e.

              INFOVAX MAILING LIST <IN%"INFO-VAX@KL.SRI.COM">o
2 /NODE 
 /NODE=nodenameE
Specifies that the folder is a remote folder at the specified nodename..
A remote folder is a folder in which the messages are actually storedr
on a folder at a remote DECNET node.  The specified nodename is checked 
to see if a folder of the same name is located on that node.  If so, the
folder will point to that folder.  This capability is only present if theD
BULLCP process is created on the remote node via the BULL/STARTUP command.
If the remote folder name is different from the local folder name, the
remote folder name is specified using the /REMOTENAME qualifier.

NOTE: If one node add a message to a remote node, other nodes connected 
to the same folder will not immediately be aware of the new message.
That information is only updated every 15 minutes (same algorithm for 
updating BBOARD messages), or if a user accesses that folder.f
2 /NOTIFYf
Specifies that all users automatically have NOTIFY set for this folder.e
Only a privileged user can use this qualifier.  (See HELP SET NOTIFY for
more information.)
2 /OWNER
 /OWNER=username
Specifies the owner of the folder.  This is a privileged command.N
2 /PRIVATE
Specifies that the folder can only be accessed by users who have been 
granted access via the SET ACCESS command.  Note: This option uses ACLs 
and users who are granted access must be entered into the Rights Data Base.A
If the RDB does not exist on your system, a privileged user will have to
create it.  If a user is not in the RDB, this program will automatically
enter the user into it (unless this feature was disabled  during the
compilation of this program).  NOTE: See HELP SET ACCESS for more info.D
2 /READNEW
Specifies that all users automatically have READNEW set for this folder.
Only a privileged user can use this qualifier.  (See HELP SET READNEW for 
more information.)
2 /REMOTENAME
 /REMOTENAME=foldernamel
Valid only if /NODE is present, i.e. that the folder is a remote folder.
Specifies the name of the remote folder name.  If not specified, it is
assumed that the remote name is the same as the local name.h
2 /SHOWNEW
Specifies that all users automatically have SHOWNEW set for this folder.
Only a privileged user can use this qualifier.  (See HELP SET SHOWNEW forb
more information.)
2 /SEMIPRIVATE
Similar to /PRIVATE, except that the folder is restricted only with 
respect to adding or modifying messages.  All users can read the folder.
2 /SYSTEMs
Specifies that the folder is a SYSTEM folder.  A SYSTEM folder is.
allowed to have SYSTEM and SHUTDOWN messages added to it.  By default,
the GENERAL folder is a SYSTEM folder.  This is a privileged command.a

If this is a remote folder, /SYSTEM cannot be specified unless the
folder at the other node is also a SYSTEM folder.e
1 CURRENTo

Displays the beginning of the message you are currently reading.  If
you  are  reading  a long message and want to display the first part
of the message again, you can enter the CURRENT command.

  Format:a

    CURRENTe
2 /EDITm
Specifies that the editor is to be used to read the message.  This ise
useful for scanning a long message.r
1 DELETE
Deletes the specified message.  If no message is specified, the currentp
message is deleted.  Only the original owner or a privileged user canS
delete a message.  Note that the message is not deleted immediately, but
its expiration is set 15 minutes in the future.  This is to allow a user
to recover the message using the UNDELETE command.  If you want thea
message deleted immediately, use the /IMMEDIATE qualifier.

  Format:
    DELETE [message_number][-message_number1] 

The message's relative number is found by the DIRECTORY command.  It iso
possible to delete a range of messages by specifying two numbers
separated by a dash, i.e. DELETE 1-5.  However, a range cannot beq
specified if the folder is remote.
2 /ALL
Specifies to delete all the messages in the folder.  Note:  This willi
not work for remote folders.  Only one message can be deleted from a
remote folder at a time.
2 /IMMEDIATE
Specifies that the message is to be deleted immediately.
2 /NODES
 /NODES=(nodes[,...])e

Specifies to delete the message at the listed DECNET nodes.  The BULLETINa
utility must be installed properly on the other nodes.  You can specifyh
a different username to use at the other nodes by either using the
USERNAME qualifier, or by specifying the nodename with 2 semi-colons
followed by the username, i.e. nodename::username.  If you specify a
username, you will be prompted for the password of the account on the 
other nodes.  The /SUBJECT must be specified to identify the specifice
message that is to be deleted.

Additionally, you can specify logical names which translate to one or 
more node names.  I.e.  $ DEFINE ALL_NODES "VAX1,VAX2,VAX3", and then,
specify /NODES=ALL_NODES.  Note that the quotation marks are required.
2 /SUBJECT
 /SUBJECT=subject 

Specifies the subject of the bulletin to be deleted at a remote DECNET
node.  The DECNET node must be specified with the /NODE qualifier.
The specified subject need not be the exact subject of the message.m
It can be a substring of the subject.  This is in case you have forgotteni
the exact subject that was specified.  Case is not critical either.i
You will be notified if the deletion was successful.
2 /USERNAMEc
Specifies username to be used at remote DECNET nodes when deleting messagese
on other DECNET nodes via the /NODE qualifier.
1 DIRECTORYg
Lists a summary of the messages.  The message number, submitter's name,t
date, and subject of each message is displayed.i

  Format:t

    DIRECTORY [folder]

If a folder is specified, that folder is selected before the directory
is listed.
2 /DESCRIBEm
Valid when used with /FOLDERS.  Specifies to include description of folder.s
2 /FOLDERS
Lists the available message folders.  Shows last message date and number
of messages in folder.  An asterisk (*) next to foldername indicates
that there are unread messages in that folder.
2 /MARKEDr
Lists messages that have been marked (indicated by an asterisk).
After using /MARKED, in order to see all messages, the folder will haveo
to be reselected using the SELECT command.
2 /NEW
Specifies to start the listing of messages with the first unread message.n
2 /SINCE
 /SINCE=date

Displays a listing of all the messages created on or after the
specified date.  If no date is specified, the default is TODAY.a
2 /START
 /START=message_number

Indicates the first message number you want to display.  For example,l
to  display  all the messages beginning with number three, enter the
command line DIRECTORY/START=3.  Not valid with /FOLDER.
1 EXIT
Exits the BULLETIN program.a
1 EXTRACTs
Synonym for FILE command.s
1 FILE
Copies the current message to the named file.  The file-name parameter
is required.  If the file exists, the message is appended to the file,
unless the /NEW qualifier is specified.

  Format:l
    FILE [message_number][-message_number1]l

A range of messages to be copied can optionally be specified, i.e.
FILE 2-5.a
2 /ALL
Copies all the messages in the current folder.
2 /HEADERw
 /[NO]HEADER

Controls whether a header containing the owner, subject, and date of the a
message is written in the file.  The default is to write the header.
2 /NEW

Specifies that a new file is to be created.  Otherwise, if the specified
file exists, the file would be appended to that file..
1 Folders 
All messages are divided into separate folders.  The default folder is
GENERAL.  New folders can be created by any user.  As an example, thes
following creates a folder for GAMES related messages: t

BULLETIN> CREATE GAMES
Enter a one line description of folder.e
GAMESa

To see the list of available folders, use DIRECTORY/FOLDERS.  To selectT
a specific folder, use the SELECT command.  

If a user selects a folder and enters the SET READNEW command, thatb
user will be alerted of topics of new messages at login time, and will p
then be given the option of reading them.  Similar to READNEW is SHOWNEW,o
which displays the topics but doesn't prompt to read them.  Even less is
SET BRIEF, which will cause only a one line output indicating that there
are new messages in the folder.  There also is the SET NOTIFY option,p
which will cause a message to be broadcast to a user's terminal alerting
the user that a new message has been added.n

A folder can be restricted to only certain users, if desired.  This is i
done by specifying CREATE/PRIVATE.  Afterwards, access to the folder is 
controlled by the creator by the SET [NO]ACCESS command.  If /SEMIPRIVATEe
rather than /PRIVATE is specified, all users can read the messages in thee
folder, but only those give access can add messages.

A folder can be converted into a remote folder using CREATE/NODE or SETa
NODE.  A remote folder is one which points to a folder on a remote DECNET 
node.  Messages added to a remote node are actually stored on the folder
on the remote node.  The BULLCP process (created by BULLETIN/STARTUP)i
must be running on the remote node for this option to be used.

A folder can be specified as a SYSTEM folder, i.e. one in which SYSTEM/l
SHUTDOWN/BROADCAST messages can be added.  By default, the GENERAL folder 
is a SYSTEM folder (and cannot be changed).  One use for this is to create
a remote SYSTEM folder which is shared by all nodes, so that the GENERAL
folder is used for messages pertaining only to the local host, while the
remote folder is used for messages pertaining to all nodes.  Another
use is to create a folder for posting SYSTEM messages only meant for a
certain UIC group.  This is done by creating a PRIVATE SYSTEM folder, anda
giving access to that UIC group.  Only users in that UIC group will seet
the messages in that folder when they log in.h
1 HELP
To obtain help on any topic, type:

        HELP  topicL

CTRL-Y only breaks out of a command when no files are open.  Otherwise,n
use CTRL-C, which will abort the program.  However, unlike CTRL-Y, you
can not resume execution using the VMS CONTINUE command.  Also note that
CTRL-C will not abort if BULLETIN is waiting for input from the terminal.N
1 INDEXf
Gives directory listing of all folders in alphabetical order. If the
INDEX command is re-entered while the listing is in progress, the listingo
will skip to the next folder.  This is useful for skipping a particularl
folder.  It also can be used to continue the listing from where one left
off after one has read a message.S

  Format:e
       INDEX
2 /MARKEDS
Shows only messages that have been marked (indicated by an asterisk).e
2 /NEW
Specifies to start the listing of each folder with the first unread message.
Otherwise, the listing will start with the first message in the folder.f
If the INDEX command is re-entered for continuing the listing, /NEW must
be respecified.t
2 /RESTART
If specified, causes the listing to be reinitialized and start from the 
first folder.t

1 LAST

Displays the last message in the current folder.

  Format:e
       LASTs
1 MAIL
Invokes the VAX/VMS Personal Mail Utility (MAIL) to send the message
which you are reading to the specified recipients.

  Format:I

    MAIL recipient-namee

The input for the recipient name is exactly the same format as used by
the MAIL utility.d
2 /HEADERr
 /[NO]HEADER

Controls whether a header containing the owner, subject, and date of the b
message is written in the mail.  The default is to write the header.
2 /SUBJECT
 /SUBJECT=text

Specifies the subject of the mail message. If the text consists of morei
than one word, enclose the text in quotation marks (").e

If you omit this qualifier, the description of the message will be used 
as the subject..
1 MARK
Sets the current or message-id message as marked. Marked messages areS
displayed with an asterisk in the left hand column of the directory=
listing.  A marked message can serve as a reminder of importantt
information.  The UNMARK command sets the current or message-id message 
as unmarked.

   Format:

       MARK [message-number or numbers]m
       UNMARK [message-number or numbers]e

NOTE: The list of marked messages are stored in a file username.BULLMARK
in the directory pointed to by the logical name BULL_MARK.  If BULL_MARK
is not defined, an error message will be displayed when attempting toE
mark a message.  BULL_MARK may be defined system wide, depending onD
whether the system manager has decided to do so.
1 MODIFY
Modifies the database information for the current folder.  Only the owner 
of the folder or a user with privileges can use this command.f

  Format:i

    MODIFY
2 /DESCRIPTION
Specifies a new description for the folder.  You will be prompted forO
the text of the description.

NOTE: If this folder is to receive messages from a network mailing listh
via the BBOARD feature, and you wish to use the POST and RESPOND/LIST*
commands, the address of the mailing list should be included in thet
description.  This is done by enclosing the address using <> and
placing it at the end of the description, i.e.

              INFOVAX MAILING LIST <IN%"INFO-VAX@KL.SRI.COM">u
2 /NAMES
 /NAME=foldernameN

Specifies a new name for the folder.
2 /OWNER
 /OWNER=username

Specifies a new owner for the folder.  If the owner does not havee
privileges, BULLETIN will prompt for the password of the new owner
account in order to okay the modification.
1 MOVE
Moves a message to another  folder and deletes it from  the  current
folder.p

  Format:p

    MOVE folder-name [message_number][-message_number1]e

The folder-name is the name of the folder to which the message is to beh
be moved to.  Optionally, a range of messages which are to be moved can be
specified following the folder name, i.e. COPY NEWFOLDER 2-5.  However,i
if the old folder is remote, they will be copied but not deleted, as
only one message can be delted from a remote folder at a time.
2 /ALL
Specifies to move all the messages from the old folder.  Note:  If the
old folder is remote, they will be copied but not deleted, as only one
message can be deleted from a remote folder at a time.
2 /MERGE
Specifies that the original date and time of the moved messages arei
saved and that the messages are placed in correct chronological order 
in the new folder.  This operation is lengthy if the new folder is large.i
2 /ORIGINAL 
Specifies that the owner of the moved message will be the original owner
of the message.  The default is that the moved message will be owned byc
the person moving the message.
1 NEXT
Skips to the next message and displays it.  This is useful when paging
through the messages and you encounter a particularly long message
that you would like to skip over.
