You  are  about  to  receive  version  2.06  of the PFC BULLETIN.
 
BULLETIN   is   public   domain   software.    (I   will  gladly  accept
recommendations for new features,  not  for  changes  that  are  due  to
"personal" preference.)
 
As of V2.0, BULLETIN is able to read USENET NEWS via TCP/IP using either
CMU, MULTINET, UCX, TWG, or via DECNET.  It can also serve as a NEWS
gateway for DECNET nodes without direct access to the NEWS server, i.e. a
DECNET node without Internet access will be able to read NEWS.
 
NOTE: The following commands can be sent to BULLETIN@ORYANA.PFC.MIT.EDU:
	SEND ALL [SINCE time]	Sends all bulletin files.
				If SINCE time specified, only files created
				since that time will be sent.
	SEND filename		Sends the specified file.	
	BUGS			Sends a list of the latest bug fixes.
	HELP or INFO		Sends a brief description of BULLETIN.
	SUBSCRIBE               Subscribes to mailing list for upgrade
                                notifications.
        UNSUBSCRIBE             Unsubscribes from mailing list.
 
There  is  also  a documentation file written by Chris Tanner from Chalk
River Nuclear Labs which can  be  used  as  handout.   To  obtain  this,
request the  file BULLETIN.DOC.  (This does not describe the NEWS reader
feature, however.)
 
NOTE:  An old bug might have changed the protection on the BULLETIN data
files.  The protection on all data files (i.e.  B*.DAT,  *.BULLFIL,  and
*.BULLDIR) should be (RWED,RWED,,).
 
This  version  includes  all  necessary  modifications to work under VMS
V5.0.  However, it will still be necessary to reassemble the ALLMACS.MAR
source  under  V5  and  relink.   The V4 version will not be installable
under V5 due to a change  in  a  shared  library  which  BULLETIN  uses.
However,  relinking  by  itself  will  not  be  enough.   You  MUST also
reassemble ALLMACS.MAR.  If you only relink,  BULLETIN  can  cause  your
system  to  crash  (the  BULLCP process will do this because it uses the
routines in ALLMACS.MAR).
 
If you are running a version of BULLETIN older than 1.52,  this  version
will  modify  the  format of some of the data files.  (This will be done
automatically  when  the  new  version  is   run).    After   successful
installation,  the  older  versions of these files can be removed.  This
format change can take a significant amount of time  if  the  folder  is
large.   If  your  site  has large folders, it is suggested that the new
version be installed during off peak hours.   NOTE: Problems  can  occur
if  the  old  version  of BULLETIN is run after the data files have been
modified.  Such a situation is possible on a cluster where each node has
installed  the  executable  separately.   To  help  installation,  a new
command procedure INSTALL_REMOTE.COM has been  included.   This  can  be
used  to install BULLETIN on several nodes from a single node.  Read the
comments in the file for information on how to use it.
 
NOTE: The BULLCP process  should  be  stopped  using  the  BULLETIN/STOP
command before the new version of BULLETIN is installed.  It can then be
restarted using the BULLETIN/STARTUP command.   (The  INSTALL_REMOTE.COM
command procedure does this automatically for remote nodes.)
 
You will be receiving 20 files (NOT NECESSARILY IN THIS ORDER!):
	1) BULLETIN.FOR
	2) BULLETIN0.FOR
	3) BULLETIN1.FOR
	4) BULLETIN2.FOR
	5) BULLETIN3.FOR
	6) BULLETIN4.FOR
	7) BULLETIN5.FOR
	8) BULLETIN6.FOR
	9) BULLETIN7.FOR
	10) BULLETIN8.FOR
	11) BULLETIN9.FOR
	12) BULLETIN10.FOR
	13) BULLETIN11.FOR
	14) ALLMACS.MAR
	15) BULLCOMS1.HLP
	16) BULLCOMS2.HLP
	17) BULLET1.COM
	18) BULLET2.COM
	19) PMDF.COM
	20) MX.COM
 
(They will be  identified  in  the  SUBJECT  header.)   BULLET1.COM  and
BULLET2.COM  are  command procedures which when run, will create several
small files.  After you run them, you can delete them.  If you have PMDF
at  your  site, you should also run PMDF.COM.  Otherwise, you can delete
it.  The same applies to  MX.   Then,  read  AAAREADME.TXT  for  BULLETN
installation instructions.
 
NOTE: When creating these files (using the EXTRACT command) from the VMS
MAIL utility, you will have to strip  off  any  mail  headers  that  are
present,  including blank lines.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Add REPLY option to READNEW feature when reading messages.  Also, really fix
the REPLY command, as mentioned in V2.06.  8/11/91
 
V 2.06
 
Added code to keep track of which messages have been read a per message basis. 
Added SEEN & UNSEEN commands.  Added /SEEN, /UNSEEN, and /UNMARKED to
DIRECTORY, INDEX, READ, and SELECT commands.  Modified directory listing to
indicate which messages have been SEEN.  7/31/91 
 
Added /NOW to PRINT command.  Messages no longer have to be printed one message
at a time.  It now works identical to VMS MAIL.  7/31/91
 
Added code to NEWS users when new groups have been created.  User will be
alerted when selecting a news group that new groups are present, and will be
instructed to type NEWS/NEWGROUP in order to see them.  7/31/91
 
Added /PRINT to DIRECTORY command to allow printing of messages which are found
by using the DIRECTORY command.  7/31/91
 
Modified directory listing display so that the first and last message in the
folder are now displayed at the top.  Fixed bug which truncated very large news
group names.  7/31/91
 
Added FIRST command to read first message found in folder.  7/31/91
 
Modified REPLY command for folders associated with mailing lists, so that the
reply message to the mailing list rather than adding a local message.  7/31/91
 
Modified code to correctly store subject headers from BBOARD mail which are
more than one line long.  Previously, the subject would be truncated.  6/18/91
 
V 2.05
 
The MARK code was modified to work with NEWS folders.  6/3/91
 
Added /FOLDER=(folder,[...]) to the SEARCH command to allow searching more than
one folder at a time.  6/13/91
 
NEWS/SUBSCRIBED listing was fixed.  If the list could not fit on a single page,
a folder was skipped when the next page was shown.  6/3/91
 
INDEX was fixed.  If it was used with the qualifiers /NEW or /MARK, and the
directory listing of a folder was displayed, and then RETURN is entered to 
skip to the next folder, the directory display of the next folder would be
incorrect.  6/3/91 
 
Fixed broadcast bug.  If a message was added with /BROADCAST to a remote folder
from a node in a cluster which was not the node that BULLCP was running on. 
The broadcast would appear twice on the cluster.  5/24/91
 
Added code to alert user if message too large to be fully broadcasted.  5/24/91
 
Added code to avoid erroneous notifications of new messages for an empty NEWS
group.  Unlike a similar fix in V2.03 which was due to a bug, this fix may not
affect all sites, as it depends on the behavior of the server.  5/22/91 
 
Fixed NEWS to FOLDER feed.  A recent change broke it.  5/22/91
 
Added /EDIT qualifier for MAIL.  5/20/91
 
Added /HEADER qualifier for LAST, BACK, and CURRENT commands.  5/19/91
 
Added TWG (Wollongong) interface for NEWS.  5/18/91
 
Fixed bug which truncated subject headers of messages created when using REPLY
and RESPOND to messages which have long subject lines.  5/12/91
 
V2.04
 
Added ALWAYS attribute for folders.  Any SYSTEM messages in a folder in which
ALWAYS has been set will be displayed every time a user logs in, rather than
just once.  Also, non-SYSTEM messages will be displayed continuously (via
whatever mode is set, i.e. READNEW, SHOWNEW, or BRIEF) until it is actually
read.  4/29/91 
 
Added capability of controlling the time between updates for BBOARD and NEWS in
BULLCP by defining the logical names BULL_BBOARD_UPDATE or BULL_NEWS_UPDATE to
the number of minutes of desired time in minutes. 4/27/91
 
Added /GROUPS= qualifier to all commands which post to NEWS groups. 4/26/91
 
Fixed bug which prevented SET SHOWNEW or READNEW from working with subscribed
news group folders. 4/25/91
 
V2.03
 
Added /FOLDER to SHOW USER in order to show the latest message that a user
has read in the specified folder.  Also added /SINCE and /START (the former
for real folders, the latter for news groups).  4/11/91
 
Fixed logic so that defining BULL_NEWS_ORGANIZATION will override the
definition defined in BULLNEWS.INC.  4/10/91
 
Fixed SEARCH command, as it broke in V2.02 when /EDIT was added to read
message commands.  There is a missing QUALIFIER EDIT in BULLCOM.CLD for the
SEARCH verb.  /EDIT now works with SEARCH.  4/9/91
 
Fixed bug in BULLCP which prevented the DECNET/INTERNET NEWS gateway software
from working with UCX.  4/9/91 
 
Fixed bug caused by V2.00 which caused incorrect listing of message during
BULL/LOGIN for remote folders.  4/3/91
 
Fixed bugs which caused erroneous new message notifications for subscribed
NEWS groups that were empty.	3/27/91
 
V 2.02
 
Include BBOARD support for MX (courtesy of goathunter@wkuvx1.bitnet).
 
Changed BBOARD algorithm so that it is now possible to have only one real
BBOARD account, and have all the others be VMS MAIL forwarding entries.
See HELP SET BBOARD MORE_INFO for more info (it's been updated).
 
Added hook to allow postings from BULLETIN to a LISTSERV mailing list to use
the BBOARD account from it was subscribed to.  See HELP SET BBOARD LISTSERV.
 
Fixed many bugs in POST, REPLY, and RESPOND.
 
Fixed /ALL for COPY, PRINT, and EXTRACT when using NEWS groups.
 
Included RMS optimizer procedure for indexed files to optimize BULLNEWS.DAT
to speed up NEWS updates.  Can be used on other files (in particular
BULLINF.DAT) in order to save space.
 
Add /EDIT to BACK, NEXT, LAST, and when entering message number.
 
Modify ADD/REPLY command to local (non-NEWS) folders so if there are new
messages present, it doesn't reset the newest message count.  Previously,
adding a message would reset the user's last read message date to that message
in order to avoid notifying the user of new messages due to the user's own
message. 
 
Fixed code so that when reading new messages, and if READ/EDIT or DELETE/IMMED-
IATE IS entered, a carriage return will read the next new message.  Previously
the wrong message would be displayed.
 
V 2.01
 
Fixed many bugs associated with USENET NEWS reading feature.
 
Added UCX interface for NEWS.
 
Added signature file for POST and RESPOND messages.
 
Added capability to specify file name for POST, REPLY, and RESPOND.
 
Added the line "In a previous message, <message-owner> wrote:" to the
beginning of a message when /EXTRACT is specified
 
Added hook for network mail to run command procedure rather then using
VMS MAIL.  BULL_MAILER can be defined to point to the procedure, and it
is called with the username and subject as the parameters.
 
V 2.00
 
Added USENET NEWS reading feature.
 
V 1.93
 
Fixed bug which wouldn't allow a permanent message to be added by a
non-privileged user in a remote folder (the folder had been setup to allow
permanent messages from non-privileged users, of course). 
 
Fixed bug which causes the DELETE command not to delete a SHUTDOWN message
without the use of /IMMEDIATE.
 
Fixed the algorithm which prevented duplicate notification of messages in
remote folders on different nodes, as duplication was still possible.
 
V 1.92
 
Fixed bug which causes BULLCP to loop when trying to cleanup a folder which
has more than 127 identifiers granted access to a folder.  Also correct
SHOW FOLDER/FULL, which had a similar problem when trying to display the
identifiers.
 
Fix PMDF interface to recognize to recognize PMDF_PROTOCOL.
 
V 1.91
 
Disallow SPAWN command for CAPTIVE account.
 
Fix MAIL command to correctly allow passing addresses with quotes, i.e.
IN%"""MRL@NERUS.PFC.MIT.EDU""".
 
V 1.90
 
SET NOTIFY now works for remote folders.
 
Avoid generating notification message due to SET NOTIFY flag if the message
was broadcasted when added using ADD/BROADCAST.
 
Bug in DIR/SINCE for remote folders fixed.  If no new messages were present,
it would incorrectly show messages.
 
Added /FF to EXTRACT command to seperate messages in the file with form feeds.
 
Allow specifying CURRENT and LAST when specifying a range of messages for
commands that accept a range, i.e. EXTRACT 1-CURRENT, CURRENT-LAST, etc.
 
Open folder files with READONLY when not writing to them in order to avoid
changing modification date, which results in unnecessary backups.
 
Modify HELP so that it won't prompt for Subtopic is there is none.
 
Prevent screen from being erased after exiting HELP.
 
Fix bug which causes CREATE/NOTIFY to crash.
 
SET NOTIFY/CLUSTER has been removed.  As of VMS V5.2, it is possible to obtain
the list of users logged in to all nodes of a cluster, so this qualifier is no
long necessary.  NOTE: You can delete all the BULL_DIR:*.NOTIFY files, as they
are no longer used.
 
BULLETIN now will use the editor specified by the SET EDITOR command within
MAIL for editing messages.
 
Typing BACK after typing a DIRECTORY command will now show the previous 
DIRECTORY display entries rather than reading the previous message.
 
Several bugs related to the MARK command were fixed.  Also the software has been
optimized so that scanning for MARKed messages should take less time.
 
/EXPIRATION added to DIRECTORY command to show expiration rather than creation
date of messages.
 
Any BULLETIN interactive command can be executed at DCL level by typing
BULLETIN "command" or BULLETIN "command1;command2;etc.".
 
The CHANGE command has been modified so a range of message can be specified,
i.e. /NUMBER=1-10.  Also, the code incorrectly misinterpreted /TEXT as meaning
to extract the old text message, whereas it should have meant that only the
text was to be changed.  This prevented a user from specifying that only the
text should be changed if that user didn't have editing enabled.  This has been
fixed.  To eliminate confusing, the /TEXT qualifier on the ADD command has been
removed (previously it was a synonym for /EXTRACT). 
 
SHOW FOLDER/FULL display of access IDs was fixed to correctly display UICs.
 
Removed security hole which occurs if you are using the old method of accessing
a remote node via /NODES (it would have required looking a the sources to find,
which one installer did and was worried about).  Because of this, if you use
this old method (i.e. via BULLETIN.COM), the object BULLETIN must be installed
in the NCP database pointing to the file BULLETIN.COM, i.e. the command
"MCR NCP SET BULLETIN FILE directory:BULLETIN.COM NUMBER 0" must be executed
during the system startup.
 
Fixed bug in /LOGIN display when erasing page if terminal is hardcopy.  No
page would be erased (of course), and the next line outputted would start where
the previous line left off, rather than starting on a new line.
 
Added BULLETIN/WIDTH=page_width for users who have BULLETIN/LOGIN in their
login procedure before the terminal is known, and whose default page width is
larger (i.e. 132) than what the terminals are (i.e. 80).
 
Added BULLETIN/PGFLQUOTA and /WSEXTENT in order to set those quotas for the
BULLCP process.
 
Added ATTACH command.
 
Modify SET STRIP so that it saves the date that the message was sent and
leaves it at the to of the message.
 
BULLETIN will search BBOARD message headers for a line that starts with
"Expires:" or "X-Expires:", followed by a date (DD MMM YYYY or similar).  It if
finds that line, it will use that date as the expiration date of the message. 
 
Added /REPLY to SEARCH command.  Modified so that it's possible to abort out of
a /SUBJECT or /REPLY search using CTRL-C (previous possible only if searching
the text for a string.  Also, if you hit CTRL-C at the wrong time, BULLETIN
would abort totally rather than just aborting the search). 
 
Added /SEARCH= /SUBJ= and /REPLY to the DIRECTORY command.  Basically this is
combining the DIRECTORY and SEARCH commands.
 
Fixed design flaw which allowed the following to occur:  If a folder is a
remote system folder, when BULLETIN/LOGIN was executed, the same messages might
be displayed on both the local and remote nodes.  BULLETIN now will know that
the user has seen the message on one node and will not display it if that user
logs in on the other node.
 
Optimized code which caused slow display of new messages when executing
BULLETIN/LOGIN without /REVERSE for a remote folder.
 
Added /PERMANENT to SET NOTIFY, SHOWNEW, BRIEF, and READNEW.  The affect is
that users will not be allowed to change the setting.  The main intent here
was to allow the removal ofthe permanent setting of SHOWNEW from the GENERAL
folder.
 
Fixed bug which would cause a SYSTEM message not to be shown if SET BRIEF was
selected for that folder, and a non-SYSTEM message was also present.
 
Added SET CONTINUOUS_BRIEF.  This causes the SET BRIEF setting to show that
there are unread new messages every time BULLETIN/LOGIN is executed, rather
than just the one time.  The BRIEF notification code has also been optimized
so that it'll take less time to notify you of new messages.
 
A major bug was fixed which was introduced in previous mods to speed up
BULLETIN/LOGIN.  The effect is that no notifications will appear for certain
folders via BULLETIN/LOGIN.  This would only happen if a folder was removed at
some time.
